 

 
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair 
 

 

 
Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit 
 

 

 
The plainer dealer the sooner lost Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity 
 

 

 
For what reason 
 

 

 
For two and sound ones too 
 

 

 
Nay not sound I pray you 
 

 

 
Sure ones then 
 

 

 
Nay not sure in a thing falsing 
 

 

 
Certain ones then 
 

 

 
Name them 
 

 

 
The one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge 
 

 

 
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things 
 

 

 
Marry and did sir namely e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature 
 

 

 
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover 
 

 

 
Thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore to the world’s end will have bald followers 
 

 

 
I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion But soft who wafts us yonder 
 
Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects I am not Adriana nor thy wife The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear That never object pleasing in thine eye That never touch well welcome to thy hand That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste Unless I spake or looked or touched or carved to thee How comes it now my husband O how comes it That thou art then estrangèd from thyself Thyself I call it being strange to me That undividable incorporate Am better than thy dear self’s better part Ah do not tear away thyself from me For know my love as easy mayst thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition or diminishing As take from me thyself and not me too How dearly would it touch thee to the quick Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body consecrate to thee By ruffian lust should be contaminate Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stained skin off my harlot brow And from my false hand cut the wedding ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it I am possessed with an adulterate blot My blood is mingled with the crime of lust For if we two be one and thou play false I do digest the poison of thy flesh Being strumpeted by thy contagion Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed I live distained thou undishonorèd
