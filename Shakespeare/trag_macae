 
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight 
 
There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep and one cried Murder That they did wake each other I stood and heard them But they did say their prayers and addressed them Again to sleep 
 

 
There are two lodged together 
 
One cried God bless us and Amen the other As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands List’ning their fear I could not say Amen When they did say God bless us 
 

 
Consider it not so deeply 
 
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen I had most need of blessing and Amen Stuck in my throat 
 

 
These deeds must not be thought After these ways so it will make us mad 
 
Methought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more Macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care The death of each day’s life sore labor’s bath Balm of hurt minds great nature’s second course Chief nourisher in life’s feast 
 

 
What do you mean 
 
Still it cried Sleep no more to all the house Glamis hath murdered sleep and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more 
 

 
Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand Why did you bring these daggers from the place They must lie there Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood 
 
I’ll go no more I am afraid to think what I have done Look on ’t again I dare not 
 

 
Infirm of purpose Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures ’Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil If he do bleed I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal For it must seem their guilt 
 
Whence is that knocking How is ’t with me when every noise appalls me What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine Making the green one red 
 

 
My hands are of your color but I shame To wear a heart so white I hear a knocking At the south entry Retire we to our chamber A little water clears us of this deed How easy is it then Your constancy Hath left you unattended Hark more knocking Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts 
 
To know my deed ’twere best not know myself Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst 
 
Here’s a knocking indeed If a man were porter of hell gate he should have old turning the key Knock knock knock Who’s there i’ th’ name of Beelzebub Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on th’ expectation of plenty Come in time Have napkins enough about you here you’ll sweat for ’t Knock knock Who’s there in th’ other devil’s name Faith here’s an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for God’s sake yet could not equivocate to heaven O come in equivocator Knock knock knock Who’s there Faith here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose Come in tailor Here you may roast your goose Knock knock Never at quiet What are you But this place is too cold for hell I’ll devil-porter it no further I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire Anon anon I pray you remember the porter 
 
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed That you do lie so late 
 
Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things 
 
What three things does drink especially provoke 
 
Marry sir nose-painting sleep and urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes It provokes the desire but it takes away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery It makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him 
 
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night 
 
That it did sir i’ th’ very throat on me but I requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast him 
 
Is thy master stirring Our knocking has awaked him Here he comes 
 
Good morrow noble sir 
 
Good morrow both 
 
Is the King stirring worthy thane 
 
Not yet 
 
He did command me to call timely on him I have almost slipped the hour 
 
I’ll bring you to him 
 
I know this is a joyful trouble to you But yet ’tis one 
 
The labor we delight in physics pain This is the door 
 
I’ll make so bold to call For ’tis my limited service 
 
Goes the King hence today 
 
He does He did appoint so 
 
The night has been unruly Where we lay Our chimneys were blown down and as they say Lamentings heard i’ th’ air strange screams of death And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to th’ woeful time The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake 
 
’Twas a rough night 
 
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it 
 
O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee 
 

 

 
What’s the matter
