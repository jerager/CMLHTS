 
Come Dromio come these jests are out of season Reserve them till a merrier hour than this Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee 
 

 

 
To me sir Why you gave no gold to me 
 

 

 
Come on sir knave have done your foolishness And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge 
 

 

 
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner My mistress and her sister stays for you 
 

 

 
Now as I am a Christian answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me 
 

 

 
I have some marks of yours upon my pate Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders But not a thousand marks between you both If I should pay your Worship those again Perchance you will not bear them patiently 
 

 

 
Thy mistress’ marks What mistress slave hast thou 
 

 

 
Your Worship’s wife my mistress at the Phoenix She that doth fast till you come home to dinner And prays that you will hie you home to dinner 
 

 

 
What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face Being forbid There take you that sir knave 
 

 

 
What mean you sir For God’s sake hold your hands Nay an you will not sir I’ll take my heels 
 

 

 
Upon my life by some device or other The villain is o’erraught of all my money They say this town is full of cozenage As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind Soul-killing witches that deform the body Disguisèd cheaters prating mountebanks And many suchlike liberties of sin If it prove so I will be gone the sooner I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave I greatly fear my money is not safe 
 
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master Sure Luciana it is two o’clock 
 
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner Good sister let us dine and never fret A man is master of his liberty Time is their master and when they see time They’ll go or come If so be patient sister 
 
Why should their liberty than ours be more 
 
Because their business still lies out o’ door 
 
Look when I serve him so he takes it ill 
 
O know he is the bridle of your will 
 
There’s none but asses will be bridled so 
 
Why headstrong liberty is lashed with woe There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky The beasts the fishes and the wingèd fowls Are their males’ subjects and at their controls Man more divine the master of all these Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas Endued with intellectual sense and souls Of more preeminence than fish and fowls Are masters to their females and their lords Then let your will attend on their accords 
 
This servitude makes you to keep unwed 
 
Not this but troubles of the marriage bed 
 
But were you wedded you would bear some sway 
 
Ere I learn love I’ll practice to obey 
 
How if your husband start some otherwhere 
 
Till he come home again I would forbear 
 
Patience unmoved No marvel though she pause They can be meek that have no other cause A wretched soul bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry But were we burdened with like weight of pain As much or more we should ourselves complain So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee With urging helpless patience would relieve me But if thou live to see like right bereft This fool-begged patience in thee will be left 
 
Well I will marry one day but to try Here comes your man Now is your husband nigh 
 
Say is your tardy master now at hand
