Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure 
 
Bring him before us 
 
Ho Bring in the lord 
 
Now Hamlet where’s Polonius 
 
At supper 
 
At supper where 
 
Not where he eats but where he is eaten A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him Your worm is your only emperor for diet We fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table That’s the end 
 
Alas alas 
 
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm 
 
What dost thou mean by this 
 
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar 
 
Where is Polonius 
 
In heaven Send thither to see If your messenger find him not there seek him i’ th’ other place yourself But if indeed you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby 
 
Go seek him there 
 
He will stay till you come 
 
Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done must send thee hence With fiery quickness Therefore prepare thyself The bark is ready and the wind at help Th’ associates tend and everything is bent For England 
 
For England 
 
Ay Hamlet 
 
Good 
 
So is it if thou knew’st our purposes 
 
I see a cherub that sees them But come for England Farewell dear mother 
 
Thy loving father Hamlet 
 
My mother Father and mother is man and wife Man and wife is one flesh and so my mother Come for England 
 
Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard Delay it not I’ll have him hence tonight Away for everything is sealed and done That else leans on th’ affair Pray you make haste And England if my love thou hold’st at aught As my great power thereof may give thee sense Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword and thy free awe Pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process which imports at full By letters congruing to that effect The present death of Hamlet Do it England For like the hectic in my blood he rages And thou must cure me Till I know ’tis done Howe’er my haps my joys will ne’er begin 
 
Go Captain from me greet the Danish king Tell him that by his license Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous If that his Majesty would aught with us We shall express our duty in his eye And let him know so 
 
I will do ’t my lord 
 
Go softly on 
 
Good sir whose powers are these 
 
They are of Norway sir 
 
How purposed sir I pray you 
 
Against some part of Poland 
 
Who commands them sir 
 
The nephew to old Norway Fortinbras 
 
Goes it against the main of Poland sir Or for some frontier 
 
Truly to speak and with no addition We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name To pay five ducats five I would not farm it Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate should it be sold in fee 
 
Why then the Polack never will defend it 
 
Yes it is already garrisoned 
 
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw This is th’ impostume of much wealth and peace That inward breaks and shows no cause without Why the man dies I humbly thank you sir 
 
God be wi’ you sir 
 
Will ’t please you go my lord 
 
I’ll be with you straight Go a little before How all occasions do inform against me And spur my dull revenge What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed A beast no more Sure He that made us with such large discourse Looking before and after gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused Now whether it be Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on th’ event A thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward I do not know Why yet I live to say This thing’s to do Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do ’t Examples gross as Earth exhort me Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed Makes mouths at the invisible event Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune death and danger dare Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honor’s at the stake How stand I then That have a father killed a mother stained Excitements of my reason and my blood And let all sleep while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain O from this time forth My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth 
 
I will not speak with her 
 
She is importunate Indeed distract her mood will needs be pitied 
 
What would she have 
 
She speaks much of her father says she hears There’s tricks i’ th’ world and hems and beats her heart Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense Her speech is nothing Yet the unshapèd use of it doth move The hearers to collection They aim at it And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them Indeed would make one think there might be thought Though nothing sure yet much unhappily 
 
’Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds 
 
Let her come in To my sick soul as sin’s true nature is Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills itself in fearing to be spilt 
 
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark 
 
How now Ophelia 
 
How should I your true love know From another one By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon
