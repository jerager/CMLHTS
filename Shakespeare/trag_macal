Saw you the Weïrd Sisters 
 
No my lord 
 
Came they not by you 
 
No indeed my lord 
 
Infected be the air whereon they ride And damned all those that trust them I did hear The galloping of horse Who was ’t came by 
 
’Tis two or three my lord that bring you word Macduff is fled to England 
 
Fled to England 
 
Ay my good lord 
 
Time thou anticipat’st my dread exploits The flighty purpose never is o’ertook Unless the deed go with it From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand And even now To crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done The castle of Macduff I will surprise Seize upon Fife give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line No boasting like a fool This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool But no more sights Where are these gentlemen Come bring me where they are 
 

 
What had he done to make him fly the land 
 
You must have patience madam 
 

 
He had none His flight was madness When our actions do not Our fears do make us traitors 
 
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear 
 

 
Wisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly He loves us not He wants the natural touch for the poor wren The most diminutive of birds will fight Her young ones in her nest against the owl All is the fear and nothing is the love As little is the wisdom where the flight So runs against all reason 
 
My dearest coz I pray you school yourself But for your husband He is noble wise judicious and best knows The fits o’ th’ season I dare not speak much further But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor From what we fear yet know not what we fear But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move I take my leave of you Shall not be long but I’ll be here again Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward To what they were before My pretty cousin Blessing upon you 
 

 
Fathered he is and yet he’s fatherless 
 
I am so much a fool should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort I take my leave at once 
 

 
Sirrah your father’s dead And what will you do now How will you live 
 
As birds do mother 
 

 
What with worms and flies 
 
With what I get I mean and so do they 
 

 
Poor bird thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime The pitfall nor the gin 
 
Why should I mother Poor birds they are not set for My father is not dead for all your saying 
 

 
Yes he is dead How wilt thou do for a father 
 
Nay how will you do for a husband 
 

 
Why I can buy me twenty at any market 
 
Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again 
 

 
Thou speak’st with all thy wit And yet i’ faith with wit enough for thee 
 
Was my father a traitor mother 
 

 
Ay that he was 
 
What is a traitor 
 

 
Why one that swears and lies 
 
And be all traitors that do so 
 

 
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged 
 
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie 
 

 
Every one
