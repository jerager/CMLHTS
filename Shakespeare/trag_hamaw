This likes me well These foils have all a length 
 
Ay my good lord 
 
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements their ordnance fire The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn Give me the cups And let the kettle to the trumpet speak The trumpet to the cannoneer without The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth Now the King drinks to Hamlet Come begin And you the judges bear a wary eye 
 
Come on sir 
 
Come my lord 
 
One 
 
No 
 
Judgment 
 
A hit a very palpable hit 
 
Well again 
 
Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine Here’s to thy health Give him the cup 
 
I’ll play this bout first Set it by awhile Come Another hit What say you 
 
A touch a touch I do confess ’t 
 
Our son shall win 
 
He’s fat and scant of breath Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet 
 
Good madam 
 
Gertrude do not drink 
 
I will my lord I pray you pardon me 
 
It is the poisoned cup It is too late 
 
I dare not drink yet madam by and by 
 
Come let me wipe thy face 
 
My lord I’ll hit him now 
 
I do not think ’t 
 
And yet it is almost against my conscience 
 
Come for the third Laertes You do but dally I pray you pass with your best violence I am afeard you make a wanton of me 
 
Say you so Come on 
 
Nothing neither way 
 
Have at you now 
 
Part them They are incensed 
 
Nay come again 
 
Look to the Queen there ho 
 
They bleed on both sides How is it my lord 
 
How is ’t Laertes 
 
Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric I am justly killed with mine own treachery 
 
How does the Queen 
 
She swoons to see them bleed 
 
No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet The drink the drink I am poisoned 
 
O villainy Ho Let the door be locked Treachery Seek it out 
 
It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain No med’cine in the world can do thee good In thee there is not half an hour’s life The treacherous instrument is in thy hand Unbated and envenomed The foul practice Hath turned itself on me Lo here I lie Never to rise again Thy mother’s poisoned I can no more The King the King’s to blame 
 
The point envenomed too Then venom to thy work 
 
Treason treason 
 
O yet defend me friends I am but hurt 
 
Here thou incestuous murd’rous damnèd Dane Drink off this potion Is thy union here Follow my mother 
 
He is justly served It is a poison tempered by himself Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee Nor thine on me 
 
Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu You that look pale and tremble at this chance That are but mutes or audience to this act Had I but time as this fell sergeant Death Is strict in his arrest O I could tell you But let it be Horatio I am dead Thou livest report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied 
 
Never believe it I am more an antique Roman than a Dane Here’s yet some liquor left 
 
As thou ’rt a man Give me the cup Let go By heaven I’ll ha ’t O God Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus unknown shall I leave behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story What warlike noise is this 
 
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To th’ ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley 
 
O I die Horatio The potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do prophesy th’ election lights On Fortinbras he has my dying voice So tell him with th’ occurrents more and less Which have solicited the rest is silence O O O O 
 
Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest Why does the drum come hither
