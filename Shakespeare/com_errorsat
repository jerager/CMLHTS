O that thou wert not poor distressèd soul 
 

 

 
You minion you are these your customers Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house 
 
O husband God doth know you dined at home Where would you had remained until this time Free from these slanders and this open shame 
 

 

 
Dined at home Thou villain what sayest thou 
 

 

 
Sir sooth to say you did not dine at home 
 

 

 
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out 
 

 

 
Perdie your doors were locked and you shut out 
 

 

 
And did not she herself revile me there 
 

 

 
Sans fable she herself reviled you there 
 

 

 
Did not her kitchen maid rail taunt and scorn me 
 

 

 
Certes she did the kitchen vestal scorned you 
 

 

 
And did not I in rage depart from thence 
 

 

 
In verity you did My bones bears witness That since have felt the vigor of his rage 
 
Is ’t good to soothe him in these contraries 
 
It is no shame The fellow finds his vein And yielding to him humors well his frenzy 
 

 

 
Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me 
 
Alas I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here who came in haste for it 
 

 

 
Money by me Heart and goodwill you might But surely master not a rag of money 
 

 

 
Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats 
 
He came to me and I delivered it 
 
And I am witness with her that she did
