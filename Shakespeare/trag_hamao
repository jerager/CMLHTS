A king of shreds and patches Save me and hover o’er me with your wings You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure 
 
Alas he’s mad 
 
Do you not come your tardy son to chide That lapsed in time and passion lets go by Th’ important acting of your dread command O say 
 
Do not forget This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose But look amazement on thy mother sits O step between her and her fighting soul Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works Speak to her Hamlet 
 
How is it with you lady 
 
Alas how is ’t with you That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep And as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm Your bedded hair like life in excrements Start up and stand an end O gentle son Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look 
 
On him on him Look you how pale he glares His form and cause conjoined preaching to stones Would make them capable Do not look upon me Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects Then what I have to do Will want true color tears perchance for blood 
 
To whom do you speak this 
 
Do you see nothing there 
 
Nothing at all yet all that is I see 
 
Nor did you nothing hear 
 
No nothing but ourselves 
 
Why look you there look how it steals away My father in his habit as he lived Look where he goes even now out at the portal 
 
This is the very coinage of your brain This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in 
 
Ecstasy My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music It is not madness That I have uttered Bring me to the test And I the matter will reword which madness Would gambol from Mother for love of grace Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks It will but skin and film the ulcerous place Whiles rank corruption mining all within Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven Repent what’s past avoid what is to come And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good 
 
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain 
 
O throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the other half Good night But go not to my uncle’s bed Assume a virtue if you have it not That monster custom who all sense doth eat Of habits devil is angel yet in this That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on Refrain tonight And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence the next more easy For use almost can change the stamp of nature And either the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency Once more good night And when you are desirous to be blest I’ll blessing beg of you For this same lord I do repent but heaven hath pleased it so To punish me with this and this with me That I must be their scourge and minister I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him So again good night I must be cruel only to be kind This bad begins and worse remains behind One word more good lady 
 
What shall I do 
 
Not this by no means that I bid you do Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse And let him for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers Make you to ravel all this matter out That I essentially am not in madness But mad in craft ’Twere good you let him know For who that’s but a queen fair sober wise Would from a paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide Who would do so No in despite of sense and secrecy Unpeg the basket on the house’s top Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To try conclusions in the basket creep And break your own neck down 
 
Be thou assured if words be made of breath And breath of life I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me 
 
I must to England you know that 
 
Alack I had forgot ’Tis so concluded on 
 
There’s letters sealed and my two schoolfellows Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged They bear the mandate they must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery Let it work For ’tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petard and ’t shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon O ’tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet This man shall set me packing I’ll lug the guts into the neighbor room Mother good night indeed This counselor Is now most still most secret and most grave Who was in life a foolish prating knave Come sir to draw toward an end with you Good night mother 
 
There’s matter in these sighs these profound heaves You must translate ’tis fit we understand them Where is your son 
 
Bestow this place on us a little while Ah mine own lord what have I seen tonight 
 
What Gertrude How does Hamlet 
 
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir Whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man 
 
O heavy deed It had been so with us had we been there His liberty is full of threats to all To you yourself to us to everyone Alas how shall this bloody deed be answered It will be laid to us whose providence Should have kept short restrained and out of haunt This mad young man But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit But like the owner of a foul disease To keep it from divulging let it feed Even on the pith of life Where is he gone 
 
To draw apart the body he hath killed O’er whom his very madness like some ore Among a mineral of metals base Shows itself pure he weeps for what is done 
 
O Gertrude come away The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence and this vile deed We must with all our majesty and skill Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern Friends both go join you with some further aid Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body Into the chapel I pray you haste in this Come Gertrude we’ll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what’s untimely done Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter As level as the cannon to his blank Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name And hit the woundless air O come away My soul is full of discord and dismay 
 
Safely stowed 
 
Hamlet Lord Hamlet 
 
But soft what noise Who calls on Hamlet O here they come 
 
What have you done my lord with the dead body 
 
Compounded it with dust whereto ’tis kin 
 
Tell us where ’tis that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel 
 
Do not believe it 
 
Believe what 
 
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own Besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king 
 
Take you me for a sponge my lord 
 
Ay sir that soaks up the King’s countenance his rewards his authorities But such officers do the King best service in the end He keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed When he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again 
 
I understand you not my lord 
 
I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear 
 
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King 
 
The body is with the King but the King is not with the body The King is a thing 
 
A thing my lord 
 
Of nothing Bring me to him Hide fox and all after 
 
I have sent to seek him and to find the body How dangerous is it that this man goes loose Yet must not we put the strong law on him He’s loved of the distracted multitude Who like not in their judgment but their eyes And where ’tis so th’ offender’s scourge is weighed But never the offense To bear all smooth and even This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved Or not at all How now what hath befallen 
 
Where the dead body is bestowed my lord We cannot get from him 
 
But where is he
