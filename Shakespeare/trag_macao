Out damned spot out I say One Two Why then ’tis time to do ’t Hell is murky Fie my lord fie a soldier and afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him 
 
Do you mark that 
 

 
The Thane of Fife had a wife Where is she now What will these hands ne’er be clean No more o’ that my lord no more o’ that You mar all with this starting 
 
Go to go to You have known what you should not 
 
She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that Heaven knows what she has known 
 

 
Here’s the smell of the blood still All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand O O O 
 
What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged 
 
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body 
 
Well well well 
 
Pray God it be sir 
 
This disease is beyond my practice Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds 
 

 
Wash your hands Put on your nightgown Look not so pale I tell you yet again Banquo’s buried he cannot come out on ’s grave 
 
Even so 
 

 
To bed to bed There’s knocking at the gate Come come come come Give me your hand What’s done cannot be undone To bed to bed to bed 
 
Will she go now to bed 
 
Directly 
 
Foul whisp’rings are abroad Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets More needs she the divine than the physician God God forgive us all Look after her Remove from her the means of all annoyance And still keep eyes upon her So good night My mind she has mated and amazed my sight I think but dare not speak 
 
Good night good doctor 
 
The English power is near led on by Malcolm His uncle Siward and the good Macduff Revenges burn in them for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man 
 
Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them That way are they coming 
 
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother 
 
For certain sir he is not I have a file Of all the gentry There is Siward’s son And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood 
 
What does the tyrant 
 
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies Some say he’s mad others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury But for certain He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule 
 
Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach Those he commands move only in command Nothing in love Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief 
 
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there 
 
Well march we on To give obedience where ’tis truly owed Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal And with him pour we in our country’s purge Each drop of us 
 
Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds Make we our march towards Birnam 
 
Bring me no more reports Let them fly all Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear What’s the boy Malcolm Was he not born of woman The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus Fear not Macbeth No man that’s born of woman Shall e’er have power upon thee Then fly false thanes And mingle with the English epicures The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear The devil damn thee black thou cream-faced loon Where got’st thou that goose-look 
 
There is ten thousand 
 
Geese villain 
 
Soldiers sir 
 
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear Thou lily-livered boy What soldiers patch Death of thy soul Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear What soldiers whey-face 
 
The English force so please you 
 
Take thy face hence Seyton I am sick at heart When I behold Seyton I say This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now I have lived long enough My way of life Is fall’n into the sere the yellow leaf And that which should accompany old age As honor love obedience troops of friends I must not look to have but in their stead Curses not loud but deep mouth-honor breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not Seyton 
 
What’s your gracious pleasure 
 
What news more 
 
All is confirmed my lord which was reported 
 
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked Give me my armor 
 
’Tis not needed yet 
 
I’ll put it on Send out more horses Skirr the country round Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armor How does your patient doctor 
 
Not so sick my lord As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest 
 
Cure her of that Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart 
 
Therein the patient Must minister to himself 
 
Throw physic to the dogs I’ll none of it Come put mine armor on Give me my staff Seyton send out Doctor the thanes fly from me Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast The water of my land find her disease And purge it to a sound and pristine health I would applaud thee to the very echo That should applaud again Pull ’t off I say What rhubarb senna or what purgative drug Would scour these English hence Hear’st thou of them 
 
Ay my good lord Your royal preparation Makes us hear something
