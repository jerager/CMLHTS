 
No no the bell ’Tis time that I were gone It was two ere I left him and now the clock strikes one 
 
The hours come back That did I never hear 
 

 

 
O yes if any hour meet a sergeant he turns back for very fear 
 
As if time were in debt How fondly dost thou reason 
 

 

 
Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to season Nay he’s a thief too Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day If he be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day 
 
Go Dromio There’s the money Bear it straight And bring thy master home immediately Come sister I am pressed down with conceit Conceit my comfort and my injury 
 

 

 
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend And everyone doth call me by my name Some tender money to me some invite me Some other give me thanks for kindnesses Some offer me commodities to buy Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me And therewithal took measure of my body Sure these are but imaginary wiles And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here 
 

 

 
Master here’s the gold you sent me for What have you got the picture of old Adam new-appareled 
 

 

 
What gold is this What Adam dost thou mean 
 

 

 
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal he that came behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you forsake your liberty 
 

 

 
I understand thee not 
 

 

 
No Why ’tis a plain case he that went like a bass viol in a case of leather the man sir that when gentlemen are tired gives them a sob and ’rests them he sir that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike 
 

 

 
What thou mean’st an officer 
 

 

 
Ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says God give you good rest 
 

 

 
Well sir there rest in your foolery Is there any ships puts forth tonight May we be gone 
 

 

 
Why sir I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you 
 

 

 
The fellow is distract and so am I And here we wander in illusions Some blessèd power deliver us from hence 
 
Well met well met Master Antipholus I see sir you have found the goldsmith now Is that the chain you promised me today 
 

 

 
Satan avoid I charge thee tempt me not
