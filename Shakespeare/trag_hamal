So long Nay then let the devil wear black for I’ll have a suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year But by ’r Lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby-horse whose epitaph is For oh for oh the hobby-horse is forgot 
 
What means this my lord 
 
Marry this is miching mallecho It means mischief 
 
Belike this show imports the argument of the play 
 
We shall know by this fellow The players cannot keep counsel they’ll tell all 
 
Will he tell us what this show meant 
 
Ay or any show that you will show him Be not you ashamed to show he’ll not shame to tell you what it means 
 
You are naught you are naught I’ll mark the play 
 
For us and for our tragedy Here stooping to your clemency We beg your hearing patiently 
 
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring 
 
’Tis brief my lord 
 
As woman’s love 
 

 
Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbèd ground And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands 
 

 
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o’er ere love be done But woe is me You are so sick of late So far from cheer and from your former state That I distrust you Yet though I distrust Discomfort you my lord it nothing must For women fear too much even as they love And women’s fear and love hold quantity In neither aught or in extremity Now what my love is proof hath made you know And as my love is sized my fear is so Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear Where little fears grow great great love grows there 
 

 
Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too My operant powers their functions leave to do And thou shall live in this fair world behind Honored beloved and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou 
 

 
O confound the rest Such love must needs be treason in my breast In second husband let me be accurst None wed the second but who killed the first 
 
That’s wormwood 
 

 
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift but none of love A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed 
 

 
I do believe you think what now you speak But what we do determine oft we break Purpose is but the slave to memory Of violent birth but poor validity Which now the fruit unripe sticks on the tree But fall unshaken when they mellow be Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt What to ourselves in passion we propose The passion ending doth the purpose lose The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy Where joy most revels grief doth most lament Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident This world is not for aye nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change For ’tis a question left us yet to prove Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love The great man down you mark his favorite flies The poor advanced makes friends of enemies And hitherto doth love on fortune tend For who not needs shall never lack a friend And who in want a hollow friend doth try Directly seasons him his enemy But orderly to end where I begun Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own So think thou wilt no second husband wed But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead 
 

 
Nor Earth to me give food nor heaven light Sport and repose lock from me day and night To desperation turn my trust and hope An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife If once a widow ever I be wife 
 
If she should break it now 
 

 
’Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep 
 

 
Sleep rock thy brain And never come mischance between us twain 
 
Madam how like you this play 
 
The lady doth protest too much methinks 
 
O but she’ll keep her word 
 
Have you heard the argument Is there no offense in ’t 
 
No no they do but jest poison in jest No offense i’ th’ world 
 
What do you call the play 
 
The Mousetrap Marry how Tropically This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is the duke’s name his wife Baptista You shall see anon ’Tis a knavish piece of work but what of that Your Majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not Let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung This is one Lucianus nephew to the king 
 
You are as good as a chorus my lord 
 
I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying 
 
You are keen my lord you are keen 
 
It would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge 
 
Still better and worse 
 
So you mis-take your husbands Begin murderer Pox leave thy damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge 
 
Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing Confederate season else no creature seeing Thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted thrice infected Thy natural magic and dire property On wholesome life usurp immediately 
 
He poisons him i’ th’ garden for his estate His name’s Gonzago The story is extant and written in very choice Italian You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife 
 
The King rises 
 
What frighted with false fire 
 
How fares my lord
