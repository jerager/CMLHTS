The King my father 
 
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you 
 
For God’s love let me hear 
 
Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encountered a figure like your father Armed at point exactly cap-à-pie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length whilst they distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with them the third night kept the watch Where as they had delivered both in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like 
 
But where was this 
 
My lord upon the platform where we watch 
 
Did you not speak to it 
 
My lord I did But answer made it none Yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion like as it would speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanished from our sight 
 
’Tis very strange 
 
As I do live my honored lord ’tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it 
 
Indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch tonight 
 
We do my lord 
 
Armed say you 
 
Armed my lord 
 
From top to toe 
 
My lord from head to foot 
 
Then saw you not his face 
 
O yes my lord he wore his beaver up 
 
What looked he frowningly 
 
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger 
 
Pale or red 
 
Nay very pale 
 
And fixed his eyes upon you 
 
Most constantly 
 
I would I had been there 
 
It would have much amazed you 
 
Very like Stayed it long 
 
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred 
 

 
Longer longer 
 
Not when I saw ’t 
 
His beard was grizzled no 
 
It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silvered 
 
I will watch tonight Perchance ’twill walk again 
 
I warrant it will 
 
If it assume my noble father’s person I’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace I pray you all If you have hitherto concealed this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsomever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue I will requite your loves So fare you well Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve I’ll visit you 
 
Our duty to your Honor 
 
Your loves as mine to you Farewell My father’s spirit in arms All is not well I doubt some foul play Would the night were come Till then sit still my soul Foul deeds will rise Though all the earth o’erwhelm them to men’s eyes 
 
My necessaries are embarked Farewell And sister as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you 
 
Do you doubt that 
 
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more 
 
No more but so 
 
Think it no more For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will but you must fear His greatness weighed his will is not his own For he himself is subject to his birth He may not as unvalued persons do Carve for himself for on his choice depends The safety and the health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister And keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent Be wary then best safety lies in fear Youth to itself rebels though none else near 
 
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whiles like a puffed and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede 
 
O fear me not I stay too long But here my father comes A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second leave 
 
Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for There my blessing with thee And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportioned thought his act Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatched unfledged courage Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Bear ’t that th’ opposèd may beware of thee Give every man thy ear but few thy voice Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry This above all to thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man Farewell My blessing season this in thee 
 
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord 
 
The time invests you Go your servants tend 
 
Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you 
 
’Tis in my memory locked And you yourself shall keep the key of it
