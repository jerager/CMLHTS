Is all our company here 
 
You were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip 
 
Here is the scroll of every man’s name which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his wedding day at night 
 
First good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point 
 
Marry our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe 
 
A very good piece of work I assure you and a merry Now good Peter Quince call forth your actors by the scroll Masters spread yourselves 
 
Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver 
 
Ready Name what part I am for and proceed 
 
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus 
 
What is Pyramus a lover or a tyrant 
 
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love 
 
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it If I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure To the rest Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates And Phibbus’ car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates This was lofty Now name the rest of the players This is Ercles’ vein a tyrant’s vein A lover is more condoling 
 
Francis Flute the bellows-mender 
 
Here Peter Quince 
 
Flute you must take Thisbe on you 
 
What is Thisbe a wand’ring knight 
 
It is the lady that Pyramus must love 
 
Nay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard coming 
 
That’s all one You shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will 
 
An I may hide my face let me play Thisbe too I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice Thisne Thisne Ah Pyramus my lover dear Thy Thisbe dear and lady dear 
 
No no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisbe 
 
Well proceed 
 
Robin Starveling the tailor 
 
Here Peter Quince 
 
Robin Starveling you must play Thisbe’s mother Tom Snout the tinker 
 
Here Peter Quince 
 
You Pyramus’ father Myself Thisbe’s father Snug the joiner you the lion’s part And I hope here is a play fitted 
 
Have you the lion’s part written Pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of study 
 
You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring 
 
Let me play the lion too I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the Duke say Let him roar again Let him roar again 
 
An you should do it too terribly you would fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all 
 
That would hang us every mother’s son 
 
I grant you friends if you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale 
 
You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day a most lovely gentlemanlike man Therefore you must needs play Pyramus 
 
Well I will undertake it What beard were I best to play it in 
 
Why what you will 
 
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard your orange-tawny beard your purple-in-grain beard or your French-crown-color beard your perfit yellow 
 
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play barefaced But masters here are your parts and I am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight There will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company and our devices known In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants I pray you fail me not 
 
We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously Take pains Be perfit Adieu 
 
At the Duke’s Oak we meet 
 
Enough Hold or cut bowstrings 
 
How now spirit Whither wander you 
 
Over hill over dale Thorough bush thorough brier Over park over pale Thorough flood thorough fire I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon’s sphere And I serve the Fairy Queen To dew her orbs upon the green The cowslips tall her pensioners be In their gold coats spots you see Those be rubies fairy favors In those freckles live their savors I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear Farewell thou lob of spirits I’ll be gone Our queen and all her elves come here anon 
 
The King doth keep his revels here tonight Take heed the Queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king She never had so sweet a changeling And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train to trace the forests wild But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy And now they never meet in grove or green By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen But they do square that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there 
 
Either I mistake your shape and making quite Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Called Robin Goodfellow Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk and sometimes labor in the quern And bootless make the breathless huswife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck Are not you he 
 
Thou speakest aright I am that merry wanderer of the night I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum down topples she And Tailor cries and falls into a cough And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there But room fairy Here comes Oberon 
 
And here my mistress Would that he were gone 
 
Ill met by moonlight proud Titania 
 
What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence I have forsworn his bed and company 
 
Tarry rash wanton Am not I thy lord
