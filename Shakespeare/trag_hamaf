Swear by his sword 
 
Well said old mole Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast A worthy pioner Once more remove good friends 
 
O day and night but this is wondrous strange 
 
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy But come Here as before never so help you mercy How strange or odd some’er I bear myself As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on That you at such times seeing me never shall With arms encumbered thus or this headshake Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase As Well well we know or We could an if we would Or If we list to speak or There be an if they might Or such ambiguous giving-out to note That you know aught of me this do swear So grace and mercy at your most need help you 
 
Swear 
 
Rest rest perturbèd spirit So gentlemen With all my love I do commend me to you And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do t’ express his love and friending to you God willing shall not lack Let us go in together And still your fingers on your lips I pray The time is out of joint O cursèd spite That ever I was born to set it right Nay come let’s go together 
 
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo 
 
I will my lord 
 
You shall do marvelous wisely good Reynaldo Before you visit him to make inquire Of his behavior 
 
My lord I did intend it 
 
Marry well said very well said Look you sir Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him As thus I know his father and his friends And in part him Do you mark this Reynaldo 
 
Ay very well my lord 
 
And in part him but you may say not well But if ’t be he I mean he’s very wild Addicted so and so And there put on him What forgeries you please marry none so rank As may dishonor him take heed of that But sir such wanton wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty 
 
As gaming my lord 
 
Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarreling drabbing you may go so far 
 
My lord that would dishonor him 
 
Faith no as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency That’s not my meaning But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in unreclaimèd blood Of general assault 
 
But my good lord 
 
Wherefore should you do this 
 
Ay my lord I would know that 
 
Marry sir here’s my drift And I believe it is a fetch of wit You laying these slight sullies on my son As ’twere a thing a little soiled i’ th’ working Mark you your party in converse him you would sound Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty be assured He closes with you in this consequence Good sir or so or friend or gentleman According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country 
 
Very good my lord 
 
And then sir does he this he does what was I about to say By the Mass I was about to say something Where did I leave 
 
At closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman 
 
At closes in the consequence ay marry He closes thus I know the gentleman I saw him yesterday or th’ other day Or then or then with such or such and as you say There was he gaming there o’ertook in ’s rouse There falling out at tennis or perchance I saw him enter such a house of sale Videlicet a brothel or so forth See you now Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth And thus do we of wisdom and of reach With windlasses and with assays of bias By indirections find directions out So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son You have me have you not 
 
My lord I have 
 
God be wi’ you Fare you well 
 
Good my lord 
 
Observe his inclination in yourself 
 
I shall my lord 
 
And let him ply his music 
 
Well my lord 
 
Farewell How now Ophelia what’s the matter 
 
O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted 
 
With what i’ th’ name of God 
 
My lord as I was sewing in my closet Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced No hat upon his head his stockings fouled Ungartered and down-gyvèd to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosèd out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me 
 
Mad for thy love 
 
My lord I do not know But truly I do fear it 
 
What said he 
 
He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the length of all his arm And with his other hand thus o’er his brow He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it Long stayed he so At last a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being That done he lets me go And with his head over his shoulder turned He seemed to find his way without his eyes For out o’ doors he went without their helps And to the last bended their light on me 
 
Come go with me I will go seek the King This is the very ecstasy of love Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passions under heaven That does afflict our natures I am sorry What have you given him any hard words of late 
 
No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his letters and denied His access to me 
 
That hath made him mad I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not coted him I feared he did but trifle And meant to wrack thee But beshrew my jealousy By heaven it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion Come go we to the King This must be known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love Come 
 
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s transformation so call it Sith nor th’ exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was What it should be More than his father’s death that thus hath put him So much from th’ understanding of himself I cannot dream of I entreat you both That being of so young days brought up with him And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That opened lies within our remedy 
 
Good gentlemen he hath much talked of you And sure I am two men there is not living To whom he more adheres If it will please you To show us so much gentry and goodwill As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance 
 
Both your Majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty 
 
But we both obey And here give up ourselves in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded 
 
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern 
 
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is 
 
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him
