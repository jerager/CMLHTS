 
Plead you to me fair dame I know you not In Ephesus I am but two hours old As strange unto your town as to your talk Who every word by all my wit being scanned Wants wit in all one word to understand 
 
Fie brother how the world is changed with you When were you wont to use my sister thus She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner 
 

 

 
By Dromio 
 

 

 
By me 
 
By thee and this thou didst return from him That he did buffet thee and in his blows Denied my house for his me for his wife 
 

 

 
Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman What is the course and drift of your compact 
 

 

 
I sir I never saw her till this time 
 

 

 
Villain thou liest for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart 
 

 

 
I never spake with her in all my life 
 

 

 
How can she thus then call us by our names Unless it be by inspiration 
 
How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave Abetting him to thwart me in my mood Be it my wrong you are from me exempt But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine Thou art an elm my husband I a vine Whose weakness married to thy stronger state Makes me with thy strength to communicate If aught possess thee from me it is dross Usurping ivy brier or idle moss Who all for want of pruning with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion 
 

 

 
To me she speaks she moves me for her theme What was I married to her in my dream Or sleep I now and think I hear all this What error drives our eyes and ears amiss Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy 
 
Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner 
 

 

 
O for my beads I cross me for a sinner This is the fairy land O spite of spites We talk with goblins owls and sprites If we obey them not this will ensue They’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue 
 
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not Dromio thou Dromio thou snail thou slug thou sot 
 

 

 
I am transformèd master am I not 
 

 

 
I think thou art in mind and so am I 
 

 

 
Nay master both in mind and in my shape 
 

 

 
Thou hast thine own form 
 

 

 
No I am an ape 
 
If thou art changed to aught ’tis to an ass
