What wilt thou hear some music my sweet love 
 
I have a reasonable good ear in music Let’s have the tongs and the bones 
 
Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat 
 
Truly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay Good hay sweet hay hath no fellow 
 
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts 
 
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas But I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon me 
 
Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms Fairies begone and be all ways away So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm O how I love thee How I dote on thee 
 
Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet sight Her dotage now I do begin to pity For meeting her of late behind the wood Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool I did upbraid her and fall out with her For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begged my patience I then did ask of her her changeling child Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in Fairyland And now I have the boy I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes And gentle Puck take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream But first I will release the Fairy Queen Be as thou wast wont to be See as thou wast wont to see Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower Hath such force and blessèd power Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen 
 
My Oberon what visions have I seen Methought I was enamored of an ass 
 
There lies your love 
 
How came these things to pass O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now 
 
Silence awhile Robin take off this head Titania music call and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense 
 
Music ho music such as charmeth sleep 
 
Now when thou wak’st with thine own fool’s eyes peep 
 
Sound music Come my queen take hands with me And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be Now thou and I are new in amity And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly And bless it to all fair prosperity There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded with Theseus all in jollity 
 
Fairy king attend and mark I do hear the morning lark 
 
Then my queen in silence sad Trip we after night’s shade We the globe can compass soon Swifter than the wand’ring moon 
 
Come my lord and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground 
 
Go one of you find out the Forester For now our observation is performed And since we have the vaward of the day My love shall hear the music of my hounds Uncouple in the western valley let them go Dispatch I say and find the Forester We will fair queen up to the mountain’s top And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction 
 
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta Never did I hear Such gallant chiding for besides the groves The skies the fountains every region near Seemed all one mutual cry I never heard So musical a discord such sweet thunder 
 
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So flewed so sanded and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew Crook-kneed and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls Slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells Each under each A cry more tunable Was never holloed to nor cheered with horn In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly Judge when you hear But soft What nymphs are these 
 
My lord this is my daughter here asleep And this Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena old Nedar’s Helena I wonder of their being here together 
 
No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May and hearing our intent Came here in grace of our solemnity But speak Egeus Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice 
 
It is my lord 
 
Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns 
 
Good morrow friends Saint Valentine is past Begin these woodbirds but to couple now 
 
Pardon my lord 
 
I pray you all stand up I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity 
 
My lord I shall reply amazèdly Half sleep half waking But as yet I swear I cannot truly say how I came here But as I think for truly would I speak And now I do bethink me so it is I came with Hermia hither Our intent Was to be gone from Athens where we might Without the peril of the Athenian law 
 
Enough enough My lord you have enough I beg the law the law upon his head They would have stol’n away They would Demetrius Thereby to have defeated you and me You of your wife and me of my consent Of my consent that she should be your wife 
 
My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither followed them Fair Helena in fancy following me But my good lord I wot not by what power But by some power it is my love to Hermia Melted as the snow seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon And all the faith the virtue of my heart The object and the pleasure of mine eye Is only Helena To her my lord Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia But like a sickness did I loathe this food But as in health come to my natural taste Now I do wish it love it long for it And will forevermore be true to it 
 
Fair lovers you are fortunately met Of this discourse we more will hear anon Egeus I will overbear your will For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit And for the morning now is something worn Our purposed hunting shall be set aside Away with us to Athens Three and three We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity Come Hippolyta 
 
These things seem small and undistinguishable Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds 
 
Methinks I see these things with parted eye When everything seems double 
 
So methinks And I have found Demetrius like a jewel Mine own and not mine own 
 
Are you sure That we are awake It seems to me That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think The Duke was here and bid us follow him 
 
Yea and my father 
 
And Hippolyta 
 
And he did bid us follow to the temple 
 
Why then we are awake Let’s follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams 
 
When my cue comes call me and I will answer My next is Most fair Pyramus Hey-ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows-mender Snout the tinker Starveling God’s my life Stolen hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man’s hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream It shall be called Bottom’s Dream because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death 
 
Have you sent to Bottom’s house Is he come home yet 
 
He cannot be heard of Out of doubt he is transported 
 
If he come not then the play is marred It goes not forward doth it 
 
It is not possible You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he 
 
No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman in Athens 
 
Yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice 
 
You must say paragon A paramour is God bless us a thing of naught 
 
Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married If our sport had gone forward we had all been made men 
 
O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost six pence a day during his life He could not have ’scaped six pence a day An the Duke had not given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus I’ll be hanged He would have deserved it Six pence a day in Pyramus or nothing
