Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistook by me Pleading for a lover’s fee Shall we their fond pageant see Lord what fools these mortals be 
 
Stand aside The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake 
 
Then will two at once woo one That must needs be sport alone And those things do best please me That befall prepost’rously 
 
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true 
 
You do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth O devilish holy fray These vows are Hermia’s Will you give her o’er Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me put in two scales Will even weigh and both as light as tales 
 
I had no judgment when to her I swore 
 
Nor none in my mind now you give her o’er 
 
Demetrius loves her and he loves not you 
 
O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine To what my love shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow That pure congealèd white high Taurus’ snow Fanned with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou hold’st up thy hand O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of bliss 
 
O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you were civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit a manly enterprise To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes With your derision None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor soul’s patience all to make you sport 
 
You are unkind Demetrius Be not so For you love Hermia this you know I know And here with all goodwill with all my heart In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my death 
 
Never did mockers waste more idle breath 
 
Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none If e’er I loved her all that love is gone My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned And now to Helen is it home returned There to remain 
 
Helen it is not so 
 
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear Look where thy love comes Yonder is thy dear 
 
Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so 
 
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go 
 
What love could press Lysander from my side 
 
Lysander’s love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light Why seek’st thou me Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so 
 
You speak not as you think It cannot be 
 
Lo she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspired have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shared The sisters’ vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us O is all forgot All schooldays’ friendship childhood innocence We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate So we grew together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries molded on one stem So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crownèd with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly ’tis not maidenly Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injury 
 
I am amazèd at your words I scorn you not It seems that you scorn me 
 
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unloved This you should pity rather than despise 
 
I understand not what you mean by this 
 
Ay do Persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport well carried shall be chronicled If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument But fare you well ’Tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy 
 
Stay gentle Helena Hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair Helena 
 
O excellent 
 
Sweet do not scorn her so 
 
If she cannot entreat I can compel 
 
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee By my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not 
 
I say I love thee more than he can do 
 
If thou say so withdraw and prove it too 
 
Quick come 
 
Lysander whereto tends all this 
 
Away you Ethiop 
 
No no He’ll Seem to break loose Take on as you would follow But yet come not You are a tame man go 
 
Hang off thou cat thou burr Vile thing let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent 
 
Why are you grown so rude What change is this Sweet love 
 
Thy love Out tawny Tartar out Out loathèd med’cine O hated potion hence 
 
Do you not jest 
 
Yes sooth and so do you 
 
Demetrius I will keep my word with thee 
 
I would I had your bond For I perceive A weak bond holds you I’ll not trust your word 
 
What Should I hurt her strike her kill her dead Although I hate her I’ll not harm her so 
 
What can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me Wherefore O me what news my love Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you loved me yet since night you left me Why then you left me O the gods forbid In earnest shall I say 
 
Ay by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer ’tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena 
 
O me You juggler you cankerblossom You thief of love What have you come by night And stol’n my love’s heart from him 
 
Fine i’ faith Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness What will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you 
 
Puppet Why so Ay that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urged her height And with her personage her tall personage Her height forsooth she hath prevailed with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I thou painted maypole Speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes 
 
I pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her
