Where are these lads Where are these hearts 
 
Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour 
 
Masters I am to discourse wonders But ask me not what for if I tell you I am not true Athenian I will tell you everything right as it fell out 
 
Let us hear sweet Bottom 
 
Not a word of me All that I will tell you is that the Duke hath dined Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps Meet presently at the palace Every man look o’er his part For the short and the long is our play is preferred In any case let Thisbe have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words Away Go away 
 
’Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of 
 
More strange than true I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys Lovers and madmen have such seething brains Such shaping fantasies that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman The lover all as frantic Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt The poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling Doth glance from heaven to Earth from Earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown the poet’s pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name Such tricks hath strong imagination That if it would but apprehend some joy It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush supposed a bear 
 
But all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigured so together More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable 
 
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth Joy gentle friends Joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts 
 
More than to us Wait in your royal walks your board your bed 
 
Come now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call Philostrate 
 
Here mighty Theseus 
 
Say what abridgment have you for this evening What masque what music How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight 
 
There is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your Highness will see first 
 
The battle with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp We’ll none of that That have I told my love In glory of my kinsman Hercules The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage That is an old device and it was played When I from Thebes came last a conqueror The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death Of learning late deceased in beggary That is some satire keen and critical Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth Merry and tragical Tedious and brief That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow How shall we find the concord of this discord 
 
A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted And tragical my noble lord it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed 
 
What are they that do play it 
 
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here Which never labored in their minds till now And now have toiled their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial 
 
And we will hear it 
 
No my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain To do you service 
 
I will hear that play For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it Go bring them in and take your places ladies 
 
I love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged And duty in his service perishing 
 
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing 
 
He says they can do nothing in this kind 
 
The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty cannot do noble respect Takes it in might not merit Where I have come great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practiced accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence Love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity 
 
So please your Grace the Prologue is addressed 
 
Let him approach 
 
If we offend it is with our goodwill That you should think we come not to offend But with goodwill To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end Consider then we come but in despite We do not come as minding to content you Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you The actors are at hand and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know 
 
This fellow doth not stand upon points 
 
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true 
 
Indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government 
 
His speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered Who is next 
 
Gentles perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on till truth make all things plain This man is Pyramus if you would know This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain This man with lime and roughcast doth present Wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder And through Wall’s chink poor souls they are content To whisper at the which let no man wonder This man with lantern dog and bush of thorn Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus’ tomb there there to woo This grisly beast which Lion hight by name The trusty Thisbe coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright And as she fled her mantle she did fall Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast And Thisbe tarrying in mulberry shade His dagger drew and died For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain At large discourse while here they do remain 
 
I wonder if the lion be to speak 
 
No wonder my lord One lion may when many asses do 
 
In this same interlude it doth befall That I one Snout by name present a wall And such a wall as I would have you think That had in it a crannied hole or chink Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe Did whisper often very secretly This loam this roughcast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall The truth is so And this the cranny is right and sinister Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper 
 
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better 
 
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord 
 
Pyramus draws near the wall Silence 
 
O grim-looked night O night with hue so black O night which ever art when day is not O night O night Alack alack alack I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this But what see I No Thisbe do I see O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me 
 
The wall methinks being sensible should curse again 
 
No in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is Thisbe’s cue She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see it will fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes 
 
O wall full often hast thou heard my moans For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee 
 
I see a voice Now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face Thisbe 
 
My love Thou art my love I think 
 
Think what thou wilt I am thy lover’s grace And like Limander am I trusty still 
 
And I like Helen till the Fates me kill 
 
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true 
 
As Shafalus to Procrus I to you 
 
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
