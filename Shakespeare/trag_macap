Bring it after me I will not be afraid of death and bane Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane 
 
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear Profit again should hardly draw me here 
 
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe 
 
We doubt it nothing 
 
What wood is this before us 
 
The Wood of Birnam 
 
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us 
 
It shall be done 
 
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t 
 
’Tis his main hope For where there is advantage to be given Both more and less have given him the revolt And none serve with him but constrainèd things Whose hearts are absent too 
 
Let our just censures Attend the true event and put we on Industrious soldiership 
 
The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate But certain issue strokes must arbitrate Towards which advance the war 
 
Hang out our banners on the outward walls The cry is still They come Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up Were they not forced with those that should be ours We might have met them dareful beard to beard And beat them backward home What is that noise 
 
It is the cry of women my good lord 
 
I have almost forgot the taste of fears The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night-shriek and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t I have supped full with horrors Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me Wherefore was that cry 
 
The Queen my lord is dead 
 
She should have died hereafter There would have been a time for such a word Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death Out out brief candle Life’s but a walking shadow a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing Thou com’st to use thy tongue thy story quickly 
 
Gracious my lord I should report that which I say I saw But know not how to do ’t 
 
Well say sir 
 
As I did stand my watch upon the hill I looked toward Birnam and anon methought The Wood began to move 
 
Liar and slave 
 
Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so Within this three mile may you see it coming I say a moving grove 
 
If thou speak’st false Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee If thy speech be sooth I care not if thou dost for me as much I pull in resolution and begin To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam Wood Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out If this which he avouches does appear There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here I ’gin to be aweary of the sun And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone Ring the alarum bell Blow wind come wrack At least we’ll die with harness on our back 
 
Now near enough Your leafy screens throw down And show like those you are You worthy uncle Shall with my cousin your right noble son Lead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do According to our order 
 
Fare you well Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight Let us be beaten if we cannot fight 
 
Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death 
 
They have tied me to a stake I cannot fly But bear-like I must fight the course What’s he That was not born of woman Such a one Am I to fear or none 
 

 
What is thy name 
 
Thou ’lt be afraid to hear it 
 

 
No though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell 
 
My name’s Macbeth 
 

 
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear 
 
No nor more fearful 
 

 
Thou liest abhorrèd tyrant With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st 
 
Thou wast born of woman But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn Brandished by man that’s of a woman born 
 
That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face If thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms Are hired to bear their staves Either thou Macbeth Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be By this great clatter one of greatest note Seems bruited Let me find him Fortune And more I beg not 
 
This way my lord The castle’s gently rendered The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight The noble thanes do bravely in the war The day almost itself professes yours And little is to do 
 
We have met with foes That strike beside us 
 
Enter sir the castle 
 
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword Whiles I see lives the gashes Do better upon them 
 
Turn hellhound turn 
 
Of all men else I have avoided thee But get thee back My soul is too much charged With blood of thine already 
 
I have no words My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out 
 
Thou losest labor As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests I bear a charmèd life which must not yield To one of woman born 
 
Despair thy charm And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb Untimely ripped 
 
Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so For it hath cowed my better part of man And be these juggling fiends no more believed That palter with us in a double sense That keep the word of promise to our ear And break it to our hope I’ll not fight with thee
