What do you see You see an ass-head of your own do you 
 
Bless thee Bottom bless thee Thou art translated 
 
I see their knavery This is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could But I will not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down here and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid The ouzel cock so black of hue With orange-tawny bill The throstle with his note so true The wren with little quill 
 
What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed 
 
The finch the sparrow and the lark The plainsong cuckoo gray Whose note full many a man doth mark And dares not answer nay for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird Who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo never so 
 
I pray thee gentle mortal sing again Mine ear is much enamored of thy note So is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me On the first view to say to swear I love thee 
 
Methinks mistress you should have little reason for that And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion 
 
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful 
 
Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn 
 
Out of this wood do not desire to go Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no I am a spirit of no common rate The summer still doth tend upon my state And I do love thee Therefore go with me I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep And sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go Peaseblossom Cobweb Mote and Mustardseed 
 
Ready 
 
And I 
 
And I 
 
And I 
 
Where shall we go 
 
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes Feed him with apricocks and dewberries With purple grapes green figs and mulberries The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glowworms’ eyes To have my love to bed and to arise And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes Nod to him elves and do him courtesies 
 
Hail mortal 
 
Hail 
 
Hail 
 
Hail 
 
I cry your Worships mercy heartily I beseech your Worship’s name 
 
Cobweb 
 
I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb If I cut my finger I shall make bold with you Your name honest gentleman 
 
Peaseblossom 
 
I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother and to Master Peascod your father Good Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too Your name I beseech you sir 
 
Mustardseed 
 
Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well That same cowardly giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master Mustardseed 
 
Come wait upon him Lead him to my bower The moon methinks looks with a wat’ry eye And when she weeps weeps every little flower Lamenting some enforcèd chastity Tie up my lover’s tongue Bring him silently 
 
I wonder if Titania be awaked Then what it was that next came in her eye Which she must dote on in extremity Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit What night-rule now about this haunted grove 
 
My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and entered in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An ass’s noll I fixèd on his head Anon his Thisbe must be answerèd And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russet-pated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the gun’s report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here o’er and o’er one falls He Murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania waked and straightway loved an ass 
 
This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice as I did bid thee do 
 
I took him sleeping that is finished too And the Athenian woman by his side That when he waked of force she must be eyed 
 
Stand close This is the same Athenian 
 
This is the woman but not this the man 
 
O why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe 
 
Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being o’er shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia I’ll believe as soon This whole Earth may be bored and that the moon May through the center creep and so displease Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murdered him So should a murderer look so dead so grim 
 
So should the murdered look and so should I Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere 
 
What’s this to my Lysander Where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me 
 
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds 
 
Out dog Out cur Thou driv’st me past the bounds Of maiden’s patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numbered among men O once tell true Tell true even for my sake Durst thou have looked upon him being awake And hast thou killed him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung 
 
You spend your passion on a misprised mood I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell 
 
I pray thee tell me then that he is well 
 
An if I could what should I get therefor 
 
A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no 
 
There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay 
 
What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love juice on some true-love’s sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true-love turned and not a false turned true 
 
Then fate o’errules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oath 
 
About the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear 
 
I go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow 
 
Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupid’s archery Sink in apple of his eye When his love he doth espy Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky When thou wak’st if she be by Beg of her for remedy
