 
Good Lord You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine I should have chid you for not bringing it But like a shrew you first begin to brawl 
 

 
The hour steals on I pray you sir dispatch 
 
You hear how he importunes me The chain 
 

 

 
Why give it to my wife and fetch your money 
 
Come come You know I gave it you even now Either send the chain or send by me some token 
 

 

 
Fie now you run this humor out of breath Come where’s the chain I pray you let me see it 
 

 
My business cannot brook this dalliance Good sir say whe’er you’ll answer me or no If not I’ll leave him to the Officer 
 

 

 
I answer you What should I answer you 
 
The money that you owe me for the chain 
 

 

 
I owe you none till I receive the chain 
 
You know I gave it you half an hour since 
 

 

 
You gave me none You wrong me much to say so 
 
You wrong me more sir in denying it Consider how it stands upon my credit 
 

 
Well officer arrest him at my suit 
 
I do and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me 
 
This touches me in reputation Either consent to pay this sum for me Or I attach you by this officer 
 

 

 
Consent to pay thee that I never had Arrest me foolish fellow if thou dar’st 
 
Here is thy fee Arrest him officer I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently 
 
I do arrest you sir You hear the suit 
 

 

 
I do obey thee till I give thee bail But sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer 
 
Sir sir I shall have law in Ephesus To your notorious shame I doubt it not 
 

 

 
Master there’s a bark of Epidamium That stays but till her owner comes aboard And then sir she bears away Our fraughtage sir I have conveyed aboard and I have bought The oil the balsamum and aqua vitae The ship is in her trim the merry wind Blows fair from land They stay for naught at all But for their owner master and yourself 
 

 

 
How now A madman Why thou peevish sheep What ship of Epidamium stays for me 
 

 

 
A ship you sent me to to hire waftage
