Where is this sight 
 
What is it you would see If aught of woe or wonder cease your search 
 
This quarry cries on havoc O proud Death What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck 
 
The sight is dismal And our affairs from England come too late The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfilled That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead Where should we have our thanks 
 
Not from his mouth Had it th’ ability of life to thank you He never gave commandment for their death But since so jump upon this bloody question You from the Polack wars and you from England Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world How these things came about So shall you hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of accidental judgments casual slaughters Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause And in this upshot purposes mistook Fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads All this can I Truly deliver 
 
Let us haste to hear it And call the noblest to the audience For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune I have some rights of memory in this kingdom Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me 
 
Of that I shall have also cause to speak And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more But let this same be presently performed Even while men’s minds are wild lest more mischance On plots and errors happen 
 
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage For he was likely had he been put on To have proved most royal and for his passage The soldier’s music and the rite of war Speak loudly for him Take up the bodies Such a sight as this Becomes the field but here shows much amiss Go bid the soldiers shoot
