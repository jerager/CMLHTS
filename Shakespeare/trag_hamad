Farewell 
 
What is ’t Ophelia he hath said to you 
 
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet 
 
Marry well bethought ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous If it be so as so ’tis put on me And that in way of caution I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor What is between you Give me up the truth 
 
He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me 
 
Affection puh You speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance Do you believe his tenders as you call them 
 
I do not know my lord what I should think 
 
Marry I will teach you Think yourself a baby That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase Running it thus you’ll tender me a fool 
 
My lord he hath importuned me with love In honorable fashion 
 
Ay fashion you may call it Go to go to 
 
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven 
 
Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows These blazes daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their promise as it is a-making You must not take for fire From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parle For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds The better to beguile This is for all I would not in plain terms from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet Look to ’t I charge you Come your ways 
 
I shall obey my lord 
 
The air bites shrewdly it is very cold 
 
It is a nipping and an eager air 
 
What hour now 
 
I think it lacks of twelve 
 
No it is struck 
 
Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk What does this mean my lord 
 
The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail and the swagg’ring upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge 
 
Is it a custom 
 
Ay marry is ’t But to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition And indeed it takes From our achievements though performed at height The pith and marrow of our attribute So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature cannot choose his origin By the o’ergrowth of some complexion Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens The form of plausive manners that these men Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star His virtues else be they as pure as grace As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal 
 
Look my lord it comes 
 
Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou com’st in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee I’ll call thee Hamlet King Father Royal Dane O answer me Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonized bones hearsèd in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly interred Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again What may this mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do 
 
It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone 
 
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground But do not go with it 
 
No by no means 
 
It will not speak Then I will follow it 
 
Do not my lord 
 
Why what should be the fear I do not set my life at a pin’s fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself It waves me forth again I’ll follow it 
 
What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o’er his base into the sea And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it The very place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath 
 
It waves me still Go on I’ll follow thee 
 
You shall not go my lord 
 
Hold off your hands 
 
Be ruled You shall not go 
 
My fate cries out And makes each petty arture in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve Still am I called Unhand me gentlemen By heaven I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me I say away Go on I’ll follow thee 
 
He waxes desperate with imagination 
 
Let’s follow ’Tis not fit thus to obey him 
 
Have after To what issue will this come 
 
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark 
 
Heaven will direct it 
 
Nay let’s follow him 
 
Whither wilt thou lead me Speak I’ll go no further 
 
Mark me 
 
I will 
 
My hour is almost come When I to sulf’rous and tormenting flames Must render up myself 
 
Alas poor ghost 
 
Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold 
 
Speak I am bound to hear 
 
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
