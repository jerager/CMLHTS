 
And I another 
 

 
I myself have all the other And the very ports they blow All the quarters that they know I’ th’ shipman’s card I’ll drain him dry as hay Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid He shall live a man forbid Weary sev’nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle peak and pine Though his bark cannot be lost Yet it shall be tempest-tossed Look what I have 
 

 
Show me show me 
 

 
Here I have a pilot’s thumb Wracked as homeward he did come 
 

 
A drum a drum Macbeth doth come 
 
The Weïrd Sisters hand in hand Posters of the sea and land Thus do go about about Thrice to thine and thrice to mine And thrice again to make up nine Peace the charm’s wound up 
 
So foul and fair a day I have not seen 
 
How far is ’t called to Forres What are these So withered and so wild in their attire That look not like th’ inhabitants o’ th’ Earth And yet are on ’t Live you Or are you aught That man may question You seem to understand me By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips You should be women And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so 
 
Speak if you can What are you 
 

 
All hail Macbeth Hail to thee Thane of Glamis 
 

 
All hail Macbeth Hail to thee Thane of Cawdor 
 

 
All hail Macbeth that shalt be king hereafter 
 
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair I’ th’ name of truth Are you fantastical or that indeed Which outwardly you show My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope That he seems rapt withal To me you speak not If you can look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate 
 

 
Hail 
 

 
Hail 
 

 
Hail 
 

 
Lesser than Macbeth and greater 
 

 
Not so happy yet much happier 
 

 
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none So all hail Macbeth and Banquo 
 

 
Banquo and Macbeth all hail 
 
Stay you imperfect speakers Tell me more By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives A prosperous gentleman and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you 
 
The earth hath bubbles as the water has And these are of them Whither are they vanished 
 
Into the air and what seemed corporal melted As breath into the wind Would they had stayed 
 
Were such things here as we do speak about Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner 
 
Your children shall be kings 
 
You shall be king 
 
And Thane of Cawdor too Went it not so 
 
To th’ selfsame tune and words Who’s here 
 
The King hath happily received Macbeth The news of thy success and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his Silenced with that In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make Strange images of death As thick as tale Came post with post and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense And poured them down before him 
 
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks Only to herald thee into his sight Not pay thee 
 
And for an earnest of a greater honor He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor In which addition hail most worthy thane For it is thine 
 
What can the devil speak true 
 
The Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me In borrowed robes 
 
Who was the Thane lives yet But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined With those of Norway or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage or that with both He labored in his country’s wrack I know not But treasons capital confessed and proved Have overthrown him 
 
Glamis and Thane of Cawdor The greatest is behind Thanks for your pains Do you not hope your children shall be kings When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them
