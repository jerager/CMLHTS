Carried to Colmekill The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones 
 
Will you to Scone 
 
No cousin I’ll to Fife 
 
Well I will thither 
 
Well may you see things well done there Adieu Lest our old robes sit easier than our new 
 
Farewell father 
 

 
God’s benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes 
 
Thou hast it now king Cawdor Glamis all As the Weïrd Women promised and I fear Thou played’st most foully for ’t Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings If there come truth from them As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine Why by the verities on thee made good May they not be my oracles as well And set me up in hope But hush no more 
 
Here’s our chief guest 
 

 
If he had been forgotten It had been as a gap in our great feast And all-thing unbecoming 
 
Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir And I’ll request your presence 
 
Let your Highness Command upon me to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit 
 
Ride you this afternoon 
 
Ay my good lord 
 
We should have else desired your good advice Which still hath been both grave and prosperous In this day’s council but we’ll take tomorrow Is ’t far you ride 
 
As far my lord as will fill up the time ’Twixt this and supper Go not my horse the better I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain 
 
Fail not our feast 
 
My lord I will not 
 
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed In England and in Ireland not confessing Their cruel parricide filling their hearers With strange invention But of that tomorrow When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly Hie you to horse Adieu Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you 
 
Ay my good lord Our time does call upon ’s 
 
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot And so I do commend you to their backs Farewell Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night To make society The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone While then God be with you Sirrah a word with you Attend those men Our pleasure 
 
They are my lord without the palace gate 
 
Bring them before us To be thus is nothing But to be safely thus Our fears in Banquo Stick deep and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared ’Tis much he dares And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety There is none but he Whose being I do fear and under him My genius is rebuked as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me And bade them speak to him Then prophet-like They hailed him father to a line of kings Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren scepter in my grip Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand No son of mine succeeding If ’t be so For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man To make them kings the seeds of Banquo kings Rather than so come fate into the list And champion me to th’ utterance Who’s there Now go to the door and stay there till we call Was it not yesterday we spoke together 
 
It was so please your Highness 
 
Well then now Have you considered of my speeches Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune which you thought had been Our innocent self This I made good to you In our last conference passed in probation with you How you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments Who wrought with them and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say Thus did Banquo 
 

 
You made it known to us 
 
I did so and went further which is now Our point of second meeting Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever 
 

 
We are men my liege 
 
Ay in the catalogue you go for men As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs The valued file Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle The housekeeper the hunter every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed whereby he does receive Particular addition from the bill That writes them all alike And so of men Now if you have a station in the file Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood say ’t And I will put that business in your bosoms Whose execution takes your enemy off Grapples you to the heart and love of us Who wear our health but sickly in his life Which in his death were perfect 
 

 
I am one my liege Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Hath so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world 
 

 
And I another So weary with disasters tugged with fortune That I would set my life on any chance To mend it or be rid on ’t 
 
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy 
 
True my lord 
 
So is he mine and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life And though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it yet I must not For certain friends that are both his and mine Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall Who I myself struck down And thence it is That I to your assistance do make love Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons 
 

 
We shall my lord Perform what you command us 
 

 
Though our lives 
 
Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time The moment on ’t for ’t must be done tonight And something from the palace always thought That I require a clearness And with him To leave no rubs nor botches in the work Fleance his son that keeps him company Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father’s must embrace the fate Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart I’ll come to you anon 
 
We are resolved my lord 
 
I’ll call upon you straight Abide within It is concluded Banquo thy soul’s flight If it find heaven must find it out tonight 
 

 
Is Banquo gone from court 
 
Ay madam but returns again tonight
