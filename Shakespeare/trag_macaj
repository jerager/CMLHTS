 
Think of this good peers But as a thing of custom ’Tis no other Only it spoils the pleasure of the time 
 
What man dare I dare Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear The armed rhinoceros or th’ Hyrcan tiger Take any shape but that and my firm nerves Shall never tremble Or be alive again And dare me to the desert with thy sword If trembling I inhabit then protest me The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow Unreal mock’ry hence Why so being gone I am a man again Pray you sit still 
 

 
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting With most admired disorder 
 
Can such things be And overcome us like a summer’s cloud Without our special wonder You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe When now I think you can behold such sights And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine is blanched with fear 
 
What sights my lord 
 

 
I pray you speak not He grows worse and worse Question enrages him At once good night Stand not upon the order of your going But go at once 
 
Good night and better health Attend his Majesty 
 

 
A kind good night to all 
 
It will have blood they say blood will have blood Stones have been known to move and trees to speak Augurs and understood relations have By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret’st man of blood What is the night 
 

 
Almost at odds with morning which is which 
 
How say’st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding 
 

 
Did you send to him sir 
 
I hear it by the way but I will send There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d I will tomorrow And betimes I will to the Weïrd Sisters More shall they speak for now I am bent to know By the worst means the worst For mine own good All causes shall give way I am in blood Stepped in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o’er Strange things I have in head that will to hand Which must be acted ere they may be scanned 
 

 
You lack the season of all natures sleep 
 
Come we’ll to sleep My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use We are yet but young in deed 
 

 
Why how now Hecate You look angerly 
 
Have I not reason beldams as you are Saucy and overbold how did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death And I the mistress of your charms The close contriver of all harms Was never called to bear my part Or show the glory of our art And which is worse all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son Spiteful and wrathful who as others do Loves for his own ends not for you But make amends now Get you gone And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i’ th’ morning Thither he Will come to know his destiny Your vessels and your spells provide Your charms and everything beside I am for th’ air This night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end Great business must be wrought ere noon Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap’rous drop profound I’ll catch it ere it come to ground And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom grace and fear And you all know security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy Hark I am called My little spirit see Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me 
 

 
Come let’s make haste She’ll soon be back again 
 
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts Which can interpret farther Only I say Things have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead And the right valiant Banquo walked too late Whom you may say if ’t please you Fleance killed For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father Damnèd fact How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too For ’twould have angered any heart alive To hear the men deny ’t So that I say He has borne all things well And I do think That had he Duncan’s sons under his key As an ’t please heaven he shall not they should find What ’twere to kill a father So should Fleance But peace For from broad words and ’cause he failed His presence at the tyrant’s feast I hear Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell Where he bestows himself 
 
The son of Duncan From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward That by the help of these with Him above To ratify the work we may again Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives Do faithful homage and receive free honors All which we pine for now And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war 
 
Sent he to Macduff 
 
He did and with an absolute Sir not I The cloudy messenger turns me his back And hums as who should say You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer 
 
And that well might Advise him to a caution t’ hold what distance His wisdom can provide Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed 
 
I’ll send my prayers with him 
 

 
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed 
 

 
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined 
 

 
Harpier cries ’Tis time ’tis time 
 

 
Round about the cauldron go In the poisoned entrails throw Toad that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty-one Sweltered venom sleeping got Boil thou first i’ th’ charmèd pot 
 
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble 
 

 
Fillet of a fenny snake In the cauldron boil and bake Eye of newt and toe of frog Wool of bat and tongue of dog Adder’s fork and blindworm’s sting Lizard’s leg and howlet’s wing For a charm of powerful trouble Like a hell-broth boil and bubble 
 
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble 
 

 
Scale of dragon tooth of wolf Witch’s mummy maw and gulf Of the ravined salt-sea shark Root of hemlock digged i’ th’ dark Liver of blaspheming Jew Gall of goat and slips of yew Slivered in the moon’s eclipse Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips Finger of birth-strangled babe Ditch-delivered by a drab Make the gruel thick and slab Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron For th’ ingredience of our cauldron 
 
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble 
 

 
Cool it with a baboon’s blood Then the charm is firm and good
