Come come no longer will I be a fool To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate Husband I’ll dine above with you today And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks Sirrah if any ask you for your master Say he dines forth and let no creature enter Come sister Dromio play the porter well 
 

 

 
Am I in Earth in heaven or in hell Sleeping or waking mad or well-advised Known unto these and to myself disguised Ill say as they say and persever so And in this mist at all adventures go 
 

 

 
Master shall I be porter at the gate 
 
Ay and let none enter lest I break your pate 
 
Come come Antipholus we dine too late 
 

 

 
Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet And that tomorrow you will bring it home But here’s a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold And that I did deny my wife and house Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this 
 

 

 
Say what you will sir but I know what I know That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink Your own handwriting would tell you what I think 
 

 

 
I think thou art an ass 
 

 

 
Marry so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear I should kick being kicked and being at that pass You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass 
 

 

 
You’re sad Signior Balthasar Pray God our cheer May answer my goodwill and your good welcome here 
 
I hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear 
 

 

 
O Signior Balthasar either at flesh or fish A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish 
 
Good meat sir is common that every churl affords 
 

 

 
And welcome more common for that’s nothing but words 
 
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast 
 

 

 
Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest But though my cates be mean take them in good part Better cheer may you have but not with better heart But soft My door is locked Go bid them let us in

Mome malt-horse capon coxcomb idiot patch Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch Dost thou conjure for wenches that thou call’st for such store When one is one too many Go get thee from the door 
 

 

 
What patch is made our porter My master stays in the street
