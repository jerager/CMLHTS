Who must hang them 
 

 
Why the honest men 
 
Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them 
 

 
Now God help thee poor monkey But how wilt thou do for a father 
 
If he were dead you’d weep for him If you would not it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father 
 

 
Poor prattler how thou talk’st 
 
Bless you fair dame I am not to you known Though in your state of honor I am perfect I doubt some danger does approach you nearly If you will take a homely man’s advice Be not found here Hence with your little ones To fright you thus methinks I am too savage To do worse to you were fell cruelty Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you I dare abide no longer 
 

 
Whither should I fly I have done no harm But I remember now I am in this earthly world where to do harm Is often laudable to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly Why then alas Do I put up that womanly defense To say I have done no harm What are these faces 
 
Where is your husband 
 

 
I hope in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him 
 
He’s a traitor 
 
Thou liest thou shag-eared villain 
 
What you egg Young fry of treachery 
 
He has killed me mother Run away I pray you 
 
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty 
 
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men Bestride our downfall’n birthdom Each new morn New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor 
 
What I believe I’ll wail What know believe and what I can redress As I shall find the time to friend I will What you have spoke it may be so perchance This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest You have loved him well He hath not touched you yet I am young but something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb T’ appease an angry god 
 
I am not treacherous 
 
But Macbeth is A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose Angels are bright still though the brightest fell Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace Yet grace must still look so 
 
I have lost my hopes 
 
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts Why in that rawness left you wife and child Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leave-taking I pray you Let not my jealousies be your dishonors But mine own safeties You may be rightly just Whatever I shall think 
 
Bleed bleed poor country Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure For goodness dare not check thee Wear thou thy wrongs The title is affeered Fare thee well lord I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp And the rich East to boot 
 
Be not offended I speak not as in absolute fear of you I think our country sinks beneath the yoke It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands But for all this When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before More suffer and more sundry ways than ever By him that shall succeed 
 
What should he be 
 
It is myself I mean in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That when they shall be opened black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb being compared With my confineless harms 
 
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth 
 
I grant him bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name But there’s no bottom none In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust and my desire All continent impediments would o’erbear That did oppose my will Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign 
 
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny It hath been Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink We have willing dames enough There cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves Finding it so inclined 
 
With this there grows In my most ill-composed affection such A stanchless avarice that were I king I should cut off the nobles for their lands Desire his jewels and this other’s house And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal Destroying them for wealth 
 
This avarice Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust and it hath been The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will Of your mere own All these are portable With other graces weighed 
 
But I have none The king-becoming graces As justice verity temp’rance stableness Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness Devotion patience courage fortitude I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Uproar the universal peace confound All unity on earth 
 
O Scotland Scotland 
 
If such a one be fit to govern speak I am as I have spoken 
 
Fit to govern No not to live O nation miserable With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father Was a most sainted king The queen that bore thee Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet Died every day she lived Fare thee well These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Hath banished me from Scotland O my breast Thy hope ends here 
 
Macduff this noble passion Child of integrity hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste But God above Deal between thee and me for even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself For strangers to my nature I am yet Unknown to woman never was forsworn Scarcely have coveted what was mine own At no time broke my faith would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life My first false speaking Was this upon myself What I am truly Is thine and my poor country’s to command Whither indeed before thy here-approach Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point was setting forth Now we’ll together and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent 
 
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’Tis hard to reconcile 
 
Well more anon Comes the King forth Comes the King forth I pray you 
 
Ay sir There are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure Their malady convinces The great assay of art but at his touch Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand They presently amend 
 
I thank you doctor 
 
What’s the disease he means 
 
’Tis called the evil A most miraculous work in this good king Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do How he solicits heaven Himself best knows but strangely visited people All swoll’n and ulcerous pitiful to the eye The mere despair of surgery he cures Hanging a golden stamp about their necks Put on with holy prayers and ’tis spoken To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy And sundry blessings hang about his throne That speak him full of grace 
 
See who comes here 
 
My countryman but yet I know him not 
 
My ever-gentle cousin welcome hither 
 
I know him now Good God betimes remove The means that makes us strangers
