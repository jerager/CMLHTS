Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead 
 
Ay and Wall too 
 
No I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company 
 
No epilogue I pray you For your play needs no excuse Never excuse For when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged But come your Bergomask Let your epilogue alone The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve Lovers to bed ’Tis almost fairy time I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatched This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed A fortnight hold we this solemnity In nightly revels and new jollity 
 
Now the hungry lion roars And the wolf behowls the moon Whilst the heavy plowman snores All with weary task fordone Now the wasted brands do glow Whilst the screech-owl screeching loud Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide Every one lets forth his sprite In the church-way paths to glide And we fairies that do run By the triple Hecate’s team From the presence of the sun Following darkness like a dream Now are frolic Not a mouse Shall disturb this hallowed house I am sent with broom before To sweep the dust behind the door 
 
Through the house give glimmering light By the dead and drowsy fire Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier And this ditty after me Sing and dance it trippingly 
 
First rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place 
 
Now until the break of day Through this house each fairy stray To the best bride-bed will we Which by us shall blessèd be And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be And the blots of Nature’s hand Shall not in their issue stand Never mole harelip nor scar Nor mark prodigious such as are Despisèd in nativity Shall upon their children be With this field-dew consecrate Every fairy take his gait And each several chamber bless Through this palace with sweet peace And the owner of it blest Ever shall in safety rest Trip away Make no stay Meet me all by break of day 
 
If we shadows have offended Think but this and all is mended That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear And this weak and idle theme No more yielding but a dream Gentles do not reprehend If you pardon we will mend And as I am an honest Puck If we have unearnèd luck Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue We will make amends ere long Else the Puck a liar call So good night unto you all Give me your hands if we be friends And Robin shall restore amends
