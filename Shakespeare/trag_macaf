Confusion now hath made his masterpiece Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord’s anointed temple and stole thence The life o’ th’ building 
 
What is ’t you say The life 
 
Mean you his Majesty 
 
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon Do not bid me speak See and then speak yourselves Awake awake Ring the alarum bell Murder and treason Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake Shake off this downy sleep death’s counterfeit And look on death itself Up up and see The great doom’s image Malcolm Banquo As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites To countenance this horror Ring the bell 
 

 
What’s the business That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house Speak speak 
 
O gentle lady ’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak The repetition in a woman’s ear Would murder as it fell O Banquo Banquo Our royal master’s murdered 
 

 
Woe alas What in our house 
 
Too cruel anywhere Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself And say it is not so 
 
Had I but died an hour before this chance I had lived a blessèd time for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality All is but toys Renown and grace is dead The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of 
 
What is amiss 
 
You are and do not know ’t The spring the head the fountain of your blood Is stopped the very source of it is stopped 
 
Your royal father’s murdered 
 
O by whom 
 
Those of his chamber as it seemed had done ’t Their hands and faces were all badged with blood So were their daggers which unwiped we found Upon their pillows They stared and were distracted No man’s life was to be trusted with them 
 
O yet I do repent me of my fury That I did kill them 
 
Wherefore did you so 
 
Who can be wise amazed temp’rate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment No man Th’ expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan His silver skin laced with his golden blood And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance there the murderers Steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known 
 

 
Help me hence ho 
 
Look to the lady 
 
Why do we hold our tongues That most may claim this argument for ours 
 
What should be spoken here where our fate Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us Let’s away Our tears are not yet brewed 
 
Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion 
 
Look to the lady And when we have our naked frailties hid That suffer in exposure let us meet And question this most bloody piece of work To know it further Fears and scruples shake us In the great hand of God I stand and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice 
 
And so do I 
 
So all 
 
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness And meet i’ th’ hall together 
 
Well contented 
 
What will you do Let’s not consort with them To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy I’ll to England 
 
To Ireland I Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer Where we are There’s daggers in men’s smiles The near in blood The nearer bloody 
 
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted and our safest way Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse And let us not be dainty of leave-taking But shift away There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left 
 

 
Threescore and ten I can remember well Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings 
 
Ha good father Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man’s act Threatens his bloody stage By th’ clock ’tis day And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame That darkness does the face of earth entomb When living light should kiss it 
 

 
’Tis unnatural Even like the deed that’s done On Tuesday last A falcon tow’ring in her pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed 
 
And Duncan’s horses a thing most strange and certain Beauteous and swift the minions of their race Turned wild in nature broke their stalls flung out Contending ’gainst obedience as they would Make war with mankind 
 

 
’Tis said they eat each other 
 
They did so to th’ amazement of mine eyes That looked upon ’t Here comes the good Macduff How goes the world sir now 
 
Why see you not 
 
Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed 
 
Those that Macbeth hath slain 
 
Alas the day What good could they pretend 
 
They were suborned Malcolm and Donalbain the King’s two sons Are stol’n away and fled which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed 
 
’Gainst nature still Thriftless ambition that will ravin up Thine own lives’ means Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth 
 
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested 
 
Where is Duncan’s body
