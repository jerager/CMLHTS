Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth 
 
O perjured woman They are both forsworn In this the madman justly chargeth them 
 

 

 
My liege I am advisèd what I say Neither disturbed with the effect of wine Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad This woman locked me out this day from dinner That goldsmith there were he not packed with her Could witness it for he was with me then Who parted with me to go fetch a chain Promising to bring it to the Porpentine Where Balthasar and I did dine together Our dinner done and he not coming thither I went to seek him In the street I met him And in his company that gentleman There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain Which God He knows I saw not for the which He did arrest me with an officer I did obey and sent my peasant home For certain ducats He with none returned Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house By th’ way we met My wife her sister and a rabble more Of vile confederates Along with them They brought one Pinch a hungry lean-faced villain A mere anatomy a mountebank A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller A needy hollow-eyed sharp-looking wretch A living dead man This pernicious slave Forsooth took on him as a conjurer And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse And with no face as ’twere outfacing me Cries out I was possessed Then all together They fell upon me bound me bore me thence And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man both bound together Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder I gained my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities 
 
My lord in truth thus far I witness with him That he dined not at home but was locked out 
 
But had he such a chain of thee or no 
 
He had my lord and when he ran in here These people saw the chain about his neck 
 

 
Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart And thereupon I drew my sword on you And then you fled into this abbey here From whence I think you are come by miracle 
 

 

 
I never came within these abbey walls Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me I never saw the chain so help me heaven And this is false you burden me withal 
 
Why what an intricate impeach is this I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup If here you housed him here he would have been If he were mad he would not plead so coldly You say he dined at home the goldsmith here Denies that saying Sirrah what say you 
 

 

 
Sir he dined with her there at the Porpentine 
 
He did and from my finger snatched that ring 
 

 

 
’Tis true my liege this ring I had of her 
 
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here 
 
As sure my liege as I do see your Grace 
 
Why this is strange Go call the Abbess hither I think you are all mated or stark mad 
 
Most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me 
 
Speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt 
 
Is not your name sir called Antipholus And is not that your bondman Dromio 
 

 

 
Within this hour I was his bondman sir But he I thank him gnawed in two my cords Now am I Dromio and his man unbound 
 
I am sure you both of you remember me 
 

 

 
Ourselves we do remember sir by you For lately we were bound as you are now You are not Pinch’s patient are you sir 
 
Why look you strange on me You know me well 
 

 

 
I never saw you in my life till now 
 
O grief hath changed me since you saw me last And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice 
 

 

 
Neither 
 
Dromio nor thou 
 

 

 
No trust me sir nor I 
 
I am sure thou dost 
 

 

 
Ay sir but I am sure I do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him
