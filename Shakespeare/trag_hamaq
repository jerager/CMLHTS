Alas sweet lady what imports this song 
 
Say you Nay pray you mark He is dead and gone lady He is dead and gone At his head a grass-green turf At his heels a stone Oh ho 
 
Nay but Ophelia 
 
Pray you mark White his shroud as the mountain snow 
 
Alas look here my lord 
 
Larded all with sweet flowers Which bewept to the ground did not go With true-love showers 
 
How do you pretty lady 
 
Well God dild you They say the owl was a baker’s daughter Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be God be at your table 
 
Conceit upon her father 
 
Pray let’s have no words of this but when they ask you what it means say you this Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day All in the morning betime And I a maid at your window To be your Valentine Then up he rose and donned his clothes And dupped the chamber door Let in the maid that out a maid Never departed more 
 
Pretty Ophelia 
 
Indeed without an oath I’ll make an end on ’t By Gis and by Saint Charity Alack and fie for shame Young men will do ’t if they come to ’t By Cock they are to blame Quoth she Before you tumbled me You promised me to wed He answers So would I ’a done by yonder sun An thou hadst not come to my bed 
 
How long hath she been thus 
 
I hope all will be well We must be patient but I cannot choose but weep to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground My brother shall know of it And so I thank you for your good counsel Come my coach Good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night 
 
Follow her close give her good watch I pray you O this is the poison of deep grief It springs All from her father’s death and now behold O Gertrude Gertrude When sorrows come they come not single spies But in battalions first her father slain Next your son gone and he most violent author Of his own just remove the people muddied Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius’ death and we have done but greenly In hugger-mugger to inter him poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts Last and as much containing as all these Her brother is in secret come from France Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father’s death Wherein necessity of matter beggared Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this Like to a murd’ring piece in many places Gives me superfluous death 
 
Alack what noise is this 
 
Attend Where is my Switzers Let them guard the door What is the matter 
 
Save yourself my lord The ocean overpeering of his list Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste Than young Laertes in a riotous head O’erbears your officers The rabble call him lord And as the world were now but to begin Antiquity forgot custom not known The ratifiers and props of every word They cry Choose we Laertes shall be king Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds Laertes shall be king Laertes king 
 
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry O this is counter you false Danish dogs 
 
The doors are broke 
 
Where is this king Sirs stand you all without 
 
No let’s come in 
 
I pray you give me leave 
 
We will we will 
 
I thank you Keep the door O thou vile king Give me my father 
 
Calmly good Laertes 
 
That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirchèd brow Of my true mother 
 
What is the cause Laertes That thy rebellion looks so giant-like Let him go Gertrude Do not fear our person There’s such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would Acts little of his will Tell me Laertes Why thou art thus incensed Let him go Gertrude Speak man 
 
Where is my father 
 
Dead 
 
But not by him 
 
Let him demand his fill 
 
How came he dead I’ll not be juggled with To hell allegiance Vows to the blackest devil Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit I dare damnation To this point I stand That both the worlds I give to negligence Let come what comes only I’ll be revenged Most throughly for my father 
 
Who shall stay you 
 
My will not all the world And for my means I’ll husband them so well They shall go far with little 
 
Good Laertes If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father is ’t writ in your revenge That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe Winner and loser 
 
None but his enemies 
 
Will you know them then 
 
To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms And like the kind life-rend’ring pelican Repast them with my blood 
 
Why now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman That I am guiltless of your father’s death And am most sensibly in grief for it It shall as level to your judgment ’pear As day does to your eye Let her come in 
 
How now what noise is that O heat dry up my brains Tears seven times salt Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye By heaven thy madness shall be paid with weight Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia O heavens is ’t possible a young maid’s wits Should be as mortal as an old man’s life Nature is fine in love and where ’tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves 
 
They bore him barefaced on the bier Hey non nonny nonny hey nonny And in his grave rained many a tear Fare you well my dove 
 
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge It could not move thus 
 
You must sing A-down a-down and you Call him a-down-a O how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter 
 
This nothing’s more than matter 
 
There’s rosemary that’s for remembrance Pray you love remember And there is pansies that’s for thoughts 
 
A document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted 
 
There’s fennel for you and columbines There’s rue for you and here’s some for me we may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays You must wear your rue with a difference There’s a daisy I would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died They say he made a good end For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy 
 
Thought and afflictions passion hell itself She turns to favor and to prettiness 
 
And will he not come again And will he not come again No no he is dead Go to thy deathbed He never will come again His beard was as white as snow All flaxen was his poll He is gone he is gone And we cast away moan God ’a mercy on his soul And of all Christians’ souls I pray God God be wi’ you
