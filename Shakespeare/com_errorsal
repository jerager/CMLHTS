Thou art Dromio thou art my man thou art thyself 
 

 

 
I am an ass I am a woman’s man and besides myself 
 

 

 
What woman’s man And how besides thyself 
 

 

 
Marry sir besides myself I am due to a woman one that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me 
 

 

 
What claim lays she to thee 
 

 

 
Marry sir such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not that I being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me 
 

 

 
What is she 
 

 

 
A very reverend body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without he say sir-reverence I have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage 
 

 

 
How dost thou mean a fat marriage 
 

 

 
Marry sir she’s the kitchen wench and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter If she lives till doomsday she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world 
 

 

 
What complexion is she of 
 

 

 
Swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept For why She sweats A man may go overshoes in the grime of it 
 

 

 
That’s a fault that water will mend 
 

 

 
No sir ’tis in grain Noah’s flood could not do it 
 

 

 
What’s her name 
 

 

 
Nell sir but her name and three quarters that’s an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip 
 

 

 
Then she bears some breadth
