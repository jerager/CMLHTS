Into my grave 
 
Indeed that’s out of the air How pregnant sometimes his replies are A happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter My lord I will take my leave of you 
 
You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life 
 
Fare you well my lord 
 
These tedious old fools 
 
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet There he is 
 
God save you sir 
 
My honored lord 
 
My most dear lord 
 
My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do you both 
 
As the indifferent children of the earth 
 
Happy in that we are not overhappy On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button 
 
Nor the soles of her shoe 
 
Neither my lord 
 
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors 
 
Faith her privates we 
 
In the secret parts of Fortune O most true She is a strumpet What news 
 
None my lord but that the world’s grown honest 
 
Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me question more in particular What have you my good friends deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither 
 
Prison my lord 
 
Denmark’s a prison 
 
Then is the world one 
 
A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o’ th’ worst 
 
We think not so my lord 
 
Why then ’tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison 
 
Why then your ambition makes it one ’Tis too narrow for your mind 
 
O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams 
 
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream 
 
A dream itself is but a shadow 
 
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow 
 
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows Shall we to th’ court For by my fay I cannot reason 
 

 
We’ll wait upon you 
 
No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore 
 
To visit you my lord no other occasion 
 
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come come deal justly with me Come come nay speak 
 
What should we say my lord 
 
Anything but to th’ purpose You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color I know the good king and queen have sent for you 
 
To what end my lord 
 
That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no 
 
What say you 
 
Nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold not off 
 
My lord we were sent for 
 
I will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen molt no feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the Earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o’erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust Man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so 
 
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts 
 
Why did you laugh then when I said man delights not me 
 
To think my lord if you delight not in man what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service 
 
He that plays the king shall be welcome his Majesty shall have tribute on me The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for ’t What players are they 
 
Even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city 
 
How chances it they travel Their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways
