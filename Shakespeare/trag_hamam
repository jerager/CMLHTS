Give o’er the play 
 
Give me some light Away 
 
Lights lights lights 
 
Why let the strucken deer go weep The hart ungallèd play For some must watch while some must sleep Thus runs the world away Would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players 
 
Half a share 
 
A whole one I For thou dost know O Damon dear This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself and now reigns here A very very pajock 
 
You might have rhymed 
 
O good Horatio I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound Didst perceive 
 
Very well my lord 
 
Upon the talk of the poisoning 
 
I did very well note him 
 
Ah ha Come some music Come the recorders For if the King like not the comedy Why then belike he likes it not perdy Come some music 
 
Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you 
 
Sir a whole history 
 
The King sir 
 
Ay sir what of him 
 
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered 
 
With drink sir 
 
No my lord with choler 
 
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler 
 
Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair 
 
I am tame sir Pronounce 
 
The Queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you 
 
You are welcome 
 
Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do your mother’s commandment If not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business 
 
Sir I cannot 
 
What my lord 
 
Make you a wholesome answer My wit’s diseased But sir such answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother Therefore no more but to the matter My mother you say 
 
Then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration 
 
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration Impart 
 
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed 
 
We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have you any further trade with us 
 
My lord you once did love me 
 
And do still by these pickers and stealers 
 
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend 
 
Sir I lack advancement 
 
How can that be when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark 
 
Ay sir but While the grass grows the proverb is something musty O the recorders Let me see one To withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil 
 
O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly 
 
I do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipe 
 
My lord I cannot 
 
I pray you 
 
Believe me I cannot 
 
I do beseech you 
 
I know no touch of it my lord 
 
It is as easy as lying Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music Look you these are the stops 
 
But these cannot I command to any utt’rance of harmony I have not the skill 
 
Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me You would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak ’Sblood do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me God bless you sir 
 
My lord the Queen would speak with you and presently 
 
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel
