Thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end 
 

 

 
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon You sent me to the bay sir for a bark 
 

 

 
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed To Adriana villain hie thee straight Give her this key and tell her in the desk That’s covered o’er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats Let her send it Tell her I am arrested in the street And that shall bail me Hie thee slave Begone On officer to prison till it come 
 

 

 
To Adriana That is where we dined Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband She is too big I hope for me to compass Thither I must although against my will For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill 
 
Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest yea or no Looked he or red or pale or sad or merrily What observation mad’st thou in this case Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face 
 
First he denied you had in him no right 
 
He meant he did me none the more my spite 
 
Then swore he that he was a stranger here 
 
And true he swore though yet forsworn he were 
 
Then pleaded I for you 
 
And what said he 
 
That love I begged for you he begged of me 
 
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love 
 
With words that in an honest suit might move First he did praise my beauty then my speech 
 
Did’st speak him fair 
 
Have patience I beseech 
 
I cannot nor I will not hold me still My tongue though not my heart shall have his will He is deformèd crooked old and sere Ill-faced worse-bodied shapeless everywhere Vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind Stigmatical in making worse in mind 
 
Who would be jealous then of such a one No evil lost is wailed when it is gone 
 
Ah but I think him better than I say And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse Far from her nest the lapwing cries away My heart prays for him though my tongue do curse 
 

 

 
Here go the desk the purse Sweet now make haste 
 
How hast thou lost thy breath 
 

 

 
By running fast 
 
Where is thy master Dromio Is he well 
 

 

 
No he’s in Tartar limbo worse than hell A devil in an everlasting garment hath him One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel A fiend a fairy pitiless and rough A wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff A backfriend a shoulder clapper one that countermands The passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell 
 
Why man what is the matter 
 

 

 
I do not know the matter He is ’rested on the case 
 
What is he arrested Tell me at whose suit 
 

 

 
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well But is in a suit of buff which ’rested him that can I tell Will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk 
 
Go fetch it sister This I wonder at That he unknown to me should be in debt Tell me was he arrested on a band 
 

 

 
Not on a band but on a stronger thing A chain a chain Do you not hear it ring 
 
What the chain
