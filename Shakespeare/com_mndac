Then I must be thy lady But I know When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida Why art thou here Come from the farthest steep of India But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskined mistress and your warrior love To Theseus must be wedded and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity 
 
How canst thou thus for shame Titania Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna whom he ravishèd And make him with fair Aegles break his faith With Ariadne and Antiopa 
 
These are the forgeries of jealousy And never since the middle summer’s spring Met we on hill in dale forest or mead By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook Or in the beachèd margent of the sea To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain The plowman lost his sweat and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard The fold stands empty in the drownèd field And crows are fatted with the murrain flock The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blessed Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set The spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazèd world By their increase now knows not which is which And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate from our dissension We are their parents and original 
 
Do you amend it then It lies in you Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman 
 
Set your heart at rest The Fairyland buys not the child of me His mother was a vot’ress of my order And in the spicèd Indian air by night Full often hath she gossiped by my side And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood When we have laughed to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind Which she with pretty and with swimming gait Following her womb then rich with my young squire Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage rich with merchandise But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with him 
 
How long within this wood intend you stay 
 
Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not shun me and I will spare your haunts 
 
Give me that boy and I will go with thee 
 
Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away We shall chide downright if I longer stay 
 
Well go thy way Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememb’rest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid’s music 
 
I remember 
 
That very time I saw but thou couldst not Flying between the cold moon and the earth Cupid all armed A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon And the imperial vot’ress passèd on In maiden meditation fancy-free Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower Before milk-white now purple with love’s wound And maidens call it love-in-idleness Fetch me that flower the herb I showed thee once The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league 
 
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes 
 
Having once this juice I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it with another herb I’ll make her render up her page to me But who comes here I am invisible And I will overhear their conference 
 
I love thee not therefore pursue me not Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one I’ll stay the other stayeth me Thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood And here am I and wood within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia Hence get thee gone and follow me no more 
 
You draw me you hard-hearted adamant But yet you draw not iron for my heart Is true as steel Leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow you 
 
Do I entice you Do I speak you fair Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you 
 
And even for that do I love you the more I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me Neglect me lose me only give me leave Unworthy as I am to follow you What worser place can I beg in your love And yet a place of high respect with me Than to be usèd as you use your dog 
 
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on thee 
 
And I am sick when I look not on you 
 
You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity 
 
Your virtue is my privilege For that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me 
 
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts 
 
The wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will The story shall be changed Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger Bootless speed When cowardice pursues and valor flies 
 
I will not stay thy questions Let me go Or if thou follow me do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood 
 
Ay in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief Fie Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex We cannot fight for love as men may do We should be wooed and were not made to woo I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell To die upon the hand I love so well 
 
Fare thee well nymph Ere he do leave this grove Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer 
 
Ay there it is 
 
I pray thee give it me I know a bank where the wild thyme blows Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine With sweet muskroses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enameled skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth Anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow 
 
Fear not my lord Your servant shall do so 
 
Come now a roundel and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute hence Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds Some war with reremice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest 
 

 
You spotted snakes with double tongue Thorny hedgehogs be not seen Newts and blindworms do no wrong Come not near our Fairy Queen 
 
Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh So good night with lullaby 
 

 
Weaving spiders come not here Hence you long-legged spinners hence Beetles black approach not near Worm nor snail do no offence 
 
Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh So good night with lullaby 
 

 
Hence away Now all is well One aloof stand sentinel 
 
What thou seest when thou dost wake Do it for thy true love take Love and languish for his sake Be it ounce or cat or bear Pard or boar with bristled hair In thy eye that shall appear When thou wak’st it is thy dear Wake when some vile thing is near 
 
Fair love you faint with wand’ring in the wood And to speak troth I have forgot our way We’ll rest us Hermia if you think it good And tarry for the comfort of the day 
 
Be it so Lysander Find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head 
 
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth 
 
Nay good Lysander For my sake my dear Lie further off yet Do not lie so near 
 
O take the sense sweet of my innocence Love takes the meaning in love’s conference I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it Two bosoms interchainèd with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth Then by your side no bed-room me deny For lying so Hermia I do not lie 
 
Lysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But gentle friend for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid So far be distant and good night sweet friend Thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end 
 
Amen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed Sleep give thee all his rest 
 
With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed 
 
Through the forest have I gone But Athenian found I none On whose eyes I might approve This flower’s force in stirring love Night and silence Who is here Weeds of Athens he doth wear This is he my master said Despisèd the Athenian maid And here the maiden sleeping sound On the dank and dirty ground Pretty soul she durst not lie Near this lack-love this kill-courtesy Churl upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe When thou wak’st let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid So awake when I am gone For I must now to Oberon 
 
Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
