 
Say to the King I would attend his leisure For a few words 
 
Madam I will 
 

 
Naught’s had all’s spent Where our desire is got without content ’Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy How now my lord why do you keep alone Of sorriest fancies your companions making Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on Things without all remedy Should be without regard What’s done is done 
 
We have scorched the snake not killed it She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly Better be with the dead Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison Malice domestic foreign levy nothing Can touch him further 
 

 
Come on gentle my lord Sleek o’er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial Among your guests tonight 
 
So shall I love And so I pray be you Let your remembrance Apply to Banquo present him eminence Both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams And make our faces vizards to our hearts Disguising what they are 
 

 
You must leave this 
 
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives 
 

 
But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne 
 
There’s comfort yet they are assailable Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal there shall be done A deed of dreadful note 
 

 
What’s to be done 
 
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow Makes wing to th’ rooky wood Good things of day begin to droop and drowse Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse Thou marvel’st at my words but hold thee still Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill So prithee go with me 
 

 
But who did bid thee join with us 
 

 
Macbeth 
 

 
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just 
 

 
Then stand with us The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn and near approaches The subject of our watch 
 

 
Hark I hear horses 
 
Give us a light there ho 
 

 
Then ’tis he The rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i’ th’ court 
 

 
His horses go about 
 

 
Almost a mile but he does usually So all men do from hence to th’ palace gate Make it their walk 
 

 
A light a light 
 

 
’Tis he 
 

 
Stand to ’t 
 
It will be rain tonight 
 

 
Let it come down 
 
O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly Thou mayst revenge O slave 
 

 
Who did strike out the light 
 

 
Was ’t not the way
