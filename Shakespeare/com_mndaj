I kiss the wall’s hole not your lips at all 
 
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway 
 
’Tide life ’tide death I come without delay 
 
Thus have I Wall my part dischargèd so And being done thus Wall away doth go 
 
Now is the wall down between the two neighbors 
 
No remedy my lord when walls are so willful to hear without warning 
 
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard 
 
The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them 
 
It must be your imagination then and not theirs 
 
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion 
 
You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perchance both quake and tremble here When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar Then know that I as Snug the joiner am A lion fell nor else no lion’s dam For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place ’twere pity on my life 
 
A very gentle beast and of a good conscience 
 
The very best at a beast my lord that e’er I saw 
 
This lion is a very fox for his valor 
 
True and a goose for his discretion 
 
Not so my lord for his valor cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose 
 
His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valor for the goose carries not the fox It is well Leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the Moon 
 
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present 
 
He should have worn the horns on his head 
 
He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference 
 
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present Myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be 
 
This is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn How is it else the man i’ th’ moon 
 
He dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff 
 
I am aweary of this moon Would he would change 
 
It appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time 
 
Proceed Moon 
 
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man i’ th’ moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog 
 
Why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon But silence Here comes Thisbe 
 
This is old Ninny’s tomb Where is my love 
 
O 
 
Well roared Lion 
 
Well run Thisbe 
 
Well shone Moon Truly the Moon shines with a good grace 
 
Well moused Lion 
 
And then came Pyramus 
 
And so the lion vanished 
 
Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight But stay O spite But mark poor knight What dreadful dole is here Eyes do you see How can it be O dainty duck O dear Thy mantle good What stained with blood Approach ye Furies fell O Fates come come Cut thread and thrum Quail crush conclude and quell 
 
This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad 
 
Beshrew my heart but I pity the man 
 
O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear Which is no no which was the fairest dame That lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer Come tears confound Out sword and wound The pap of Pyramus Ay that left pap Where heart doth hop Thus die I thus thus thus Now am I dead Now am I fled My soul is in the sky Tongue lose thy light Moon take thy flight Now die die die die die 
 
No die but an ace for him for he is but one 
 
Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing 
 
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass 
 
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover 
 
She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the play 
 
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief 
 
A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us she for a woman God bless us 
 
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes 
 
And thus she means videlicet 
 
Asleep my love What dead my dove O Pyramus arise Speak speak Quite dumb Dead Dead A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes These lily lips This cherry nose These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone are gone Lovers make moan His eyes were green as leeks O Sisters Three Come come to me With hands as pale as milk Lay them in gore Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk Tongue not a word Come trusty sword Come blade my breast imbrue And farewell friends Thus Thisbe ends Adieu adieu adieu
