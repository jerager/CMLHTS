There’s but one down The son is fled 
 

 
We have lost best half of our affair 
 

 
Well let’s away and say how much is done 
 
You know your own degrees sit down At first And last the hearty welcome 
 
Thanks to your Majesty 
 
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host Our hostess keeps her state but in best time We will require her welcome 
 

 
Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends For my heart speaks they are welcome 
 
See they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks Both sides are even Here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst Be large in mirth Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round There’s blood upon thy face 
 
’Tis Banquo’s then 
 
’Tis better thee without than he within Is he dispatched 
 
My lord his throat is cut That I did for him 
 
Thou art the best o’ th’ cutthroats Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance If thou didst it thou art the nonpareil 
 
Most royal sir Fleance is ’scaped 
 
Then comes my fit again I had else been perfect Whole as the marble founded as the rock As broad and general as the casing air But now I am cabined cribbed confined bound in To saucy doubts and fears But Banquo’s safe 
 
Ay my good lord Safe in a ditch he bides With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head The least a death to nature 
 
Thanks for that There the grown serpent lies The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed No teeth for th’ present Get thee gone Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again 
 

 
My royal lord You do not give the cheer The feast is sold That is not often vouched while ’tis a-making ’Tis given with welcome To feed were best at home From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony Meeting were bare without it 
 
Sweet remembrancer Now good digestion wait on appetite And health on both 
 
May ’t please your Highness sit 
 
Here had we now our country’s honor roofed Were the graced person of our Banquo present Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance 
 
His absence sir Lays blame upon his promise Please ’t your Highness To grace us with your royal company 
 
The table’s full 
 
Here is a place reserved sir 
 
Where 
 
Here my good lord What is ’t that moves your Highness 
 
Which of you have done this 
 
What my good lord 
 
Thou canst not say I did it Never shake Thy gory locks at me 
 
Gentlemen rise His Highness is not well 
 

 
Sit worthy friends My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat The fit is momentary upon a thought He will again be well If much you note him You shall offend him and extend his passion Feed and regard him not Are you a man 
 
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that Which might appall the devil 
 

 
O proper stuff This is the very painting of your fear This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts Impostors to true fear would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire Authorized by her grandam Shame itself Why do you make such faces When all’s done You look but on a stool 
 
Prithee see there Behold look Lo how say you Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back our monuments Shall be the maws of kites 
 

 
What quite unmanned in folly 
 
If I stand here I saw him 
 

 
Fie for shame 
 
Blood hath been shed ere now i’ th’ olden time Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal Ay and since too murders have been performed Too terrible for the ear The time has been That when the brains were out the man would die And there an end But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools This is more strange Than such a murder is 
 

 
My worthy lord Your noble friends do lack you 
 
I do forget Do not muse at me my most worthy friends I have a strange infirmity which is nothing To those that know me Come love and health to all Then I’ll sit down Give me some wine Fill full I drink to th’ general joy o’ th’ whole table And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss Would he were here To all and him we thirst And all to all 
 
Our duties and the pledge 
 
Avaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with
