Ay amen 
 
Th’ ambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully returned 
 
Thou still hast been the father of good news 
 
Have I my lord I assure my good liege I hold my duty as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious king And I do think or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy 
 
O speak of that That do I long to hear 
 
Give first admittance to th’ ambassadors My news shall be the fruit to that great feast 
 
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper 
 
I doubt it is no other but the main His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage 
 
Well we shall sift him Welcome my good friends Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway 
 
Most fair return of greetings and desires Upon our first he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies which to him appeared To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack But better looked into he truly found It was against your Highness Whereat grieved That so his sickness age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th’ assay of arms against your Majesty Whereon old Norway overcome with joy Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before against the Polack With an entreaty herein further shown That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down 
 
It likes us well And at our more considered time we’ll read Answer and think upon this business Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor Go to your rest At night we’ll feast together Most welcome home 
 
This business is well ended My liege and madam to expostulate What majesty should be what duty is Why day is day night night and time is time Were nothing but to waste night day and time Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes I will be brief Your noble son is mad Mad call I it for to define true madness What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad But let that go 
 
More matter with less art 
 
Madam I swear I use no art at all That he’s mad ’tis true ’tis true ’tis pity And pity ’tis ’tis true a foolish figure But farewell it for I will use no art Mad let us grant him then and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect Or rather say the cause of this defect For this effect defective comes by cause Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend I have a daughter have while she is mine Who in her duty and obedience mark Hath given me this Now gather and surmise To the celestial and my soul’s idol the most beautified Ophelia That’s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase But you shall hear Thus In her excellent white bosom these etc. 
 
Came this from Hamlet to her 
 
Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move Doubt truth to be a liar But never doubt I love O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans but that I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him Hamlet This in obedience hath my daughter shown me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell out by time by means and place All given to mine ear 
 
But how hath she received his love 
 
What do you think of me 
 
As of a man faithful and honorable 
 
I would fain prove so But what might you think When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceived it I must tell you that Before my daughter told me what might you Or my dear Majesty your queen here think If I had played the desk or table-book Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb Or looked upon this love with idle sight What might you think No I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star This must not be And then I prescripts gave her That she should lock herself from his resort Admit no messengers receive no tokens Which done she took the fruits of my advice And he repelled a short tale to make Fell into a sadness then into a fast Thence to a watch thence into a weakness Thence to a lightness and by this declension Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we mourn for 
 
Do you think ’tis this 
 
It may be very like 
 
Hath there been such a time I would fain know that That I have positively said ’Tis so When it proved otherwise 
 
Not that I know 
 
Take this from this if this be otherwise If circumstances lead me I will find Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed Within the center 
 
How may we try it further 
 
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby 
 
So he does indeed 
 
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him Be you and I behind an arras then Mark the encounter If he love her not And be not from his reason fall’n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters 
 
We will try it 
 
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading 
 
Away I do beseech you both away I’ll board him presently O give me leave How does my good Lord Hamlet 
 
Well God-a-mercy 
 
Do you know me my lord 
 
Excellent well You are a fishmonger 
 
Not I my lord 
 
Then I would you were so honest a man 
 
Honest my lord 
 
Ay sir To be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand 
 
That’s very true my lord 
 
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter 
 
I have my lord 
 
Let her not walk i’ th’ sun Conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to ’t 
 
How say you by that Still harping on my daughter Yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger He is far gone And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this I’ll speak to him again What do you read my lord 
 
Words words words 
 
What is the matter my lord 
 
Between who 
 
I mean the matter that you read my lord 
 
Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as I am if like a crab you could go backward 
 
Though this be madness yet there is method in ’t Will you walk out of the air my lord
