Then yield thee coward And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time We’ll have thee as our rarer monsters are Painted upon a pole and underwrit Here may you see the tyrant 
 
I will not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet And to be baited with the rabble’s curse Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane And thou opposed being of no woman born Yet I will try the last Before my body I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff And damned be him that first cries Hold Enough 
 
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived 
 
Some must go off and yet by these I see So great a day as this is cheaply bought 
 
Macduff is missing and your noble son 
 
Your son my lord has paid a soldier’s debt He only lived but till he was a man The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought But like a man he died 
 
Then he is dead 
 
Ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth for then It hath no end 
 
Had he his hurts before 
 
Ay on the front 
 
Why then God’s soldier be he Had I as many sons as I have hairs I would not wish them to a fairer death And so his knell is knolled 
 
He’s worth more sorrow and that I’ll spend for him 
 
He’s worth no more They say he parted well and paid his score And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort 
 
Hail King for so thou art Behold where stands Th’ usurper’s cursèd head The time is free I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl That speak my salutation in their minds Whose voices I desire aloud with mine Hail King of Scotland 
 
Hail King of Scotland 
 
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named What’s more to do Which would be planted newly with the time As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen Who as ’tis thought by self and violent hands Took off her life this and what needful else That calls upon us by the grace of grace We will perform in measure time and place So thanks to all at once and to each one Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone
