You should for that have reprehended him 
 
Why so I did 
 
Ay but not rough enough 
 
As roughly as my modesty would let me 
 
Haply in private 
 
And in assemblies too 
 
Ay but not enough 
 
It was the copy of our conference In bed he slept not for my urging it At board he fed not for my urging it Alone it was the subject of my theme In company I often glancèd it Still did I tell him it was vile and bad 
 
And thereof came it that the man was mad The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing And thereof comes it that his head is light Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings Unquiet meals make ill digestions Thereof the raging fire of fever bred And what’s a fever but a fit of madness Thou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls Sweet recreation barred what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life In food in sport and life-preserving rest To be disturbed would mad or man or beast The consequence is then thy jealous fits Hath scared thy husband from the use of wits 
 
She never reprehended him but mildly When he demeaned himself rough rude and wildly Why bear you these rebukes and answer not 
 
She did betray me to my own reproof Good people enter and lay hold on him 
 
No not a creature enters in my house 
 
Then let your servants bring my husband forth 
 
Neither He took this place for sanctuary And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again Or lose my labor in assaying it 
 
I will attend my husband be his nurse Diet his sickness for it is my office And will have no attorney but myself And therefore let me have him home with me 
 
Be patient for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approvèd means I have With wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers To make of him a formal man again It is a branch and parcel of mine oath A charitable duty of my order Therefore depart and leave him here with me 
 
I will not hence and leave my husband here And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife 
 
Be quiet and depart Thou shalt not have him 
 
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity 
 
Come go I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess 
 

 
By this I think the dial points at five Anon I’m sure the Duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale The place of death and sorry execution Behind the ditches of the abbey here 
 
Upon what cause 
 

 
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town Beheaded publicly for his offense 
 
See where they come We will behold his death 
 
Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey 
 
Yet once again proclaim it publicly If any friend will pay the sum for him He shall not die so much we tender him 
 
Justice most sacred duke against the Abbess 
 
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong 
 
May it please your Grace Antipholus my husband Who I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him That desp’rately he hurried through the street With him his bondman all as mad as he Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses bearing thence Rings jewels anything his rage did like Once did I get him bound and sent him home Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went That here and there his fury had committed Anon I wot not by what strong escape He broke from those that had the guard of him And with his mad attendant and himself Each one with ireful passion with drawn swords Met us again and madly bent on us Chased us away till raising of more aid We came again to bind them Then they fled Into this abbey whither we pursued them And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence Therefore most gracious duke with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help 
 
Long since thy husband served me in my wars And I to thee engaged a prince’s word When thou didst make him master of thy bed To do him all the grace and good I could Go some of you knock at the abbey gate And bid the Lady Abbess come to me I will determine this before I stir 
 
O mistress mistress shift and save yourself My master and his man are both broke loose Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire And ever as it blazed they threw on him Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair My master preaches patience to him and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool And sure unless you send some present help Between them they will kill the conjurer 
 
Peace fool Thy master and his man are here And that is false thou dost report to us 
 
Mistress upon my life I tell you true I have not breathed almost since I did see it He cries for you and vows if he can take you To scorch your face and to disfigure you Hark hark I hear him mistress Fly begone 
 
Come stand by me Fear nothing Guard with halberds 
 
Ay me it is my husband Witness you That he is borne about invisible Even now we housed him in the abbey here And now he’s there past thought of human reason 
 

 

 
Justice most gracious duke O grant me justice Even for the service that long since I did thee When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life Even for the blood That then I lost for thee now grant me justice 
 
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote I see my son Antipholus and Dromio 
 

 

 
Justice sweet prince against that woman there She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife That hath abusèd and dishonored me Even in the strength and height of injury Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me 
 
Discover how and thou shalt find me just 
 

 

 
This day great duke she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house 
 
A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so 
 
No my good lord Myself he and my sister Today did dine together So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal
