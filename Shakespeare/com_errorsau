 
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope 
 
Mistress both man and master is possessed I know it by their pale and deadly looks They must be bound and laid in some dark room 
 

 

 
Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today And why dost thou deny the bag of gold 
 
I did not gentle husband lock thee forth 
 

 

 
And gentle master I received no gold But I confess sir that we were locked out 
 
Dissembling villain thou speak’st false in both 
 

 

 
Dissembling harlot thou art false in all And art confederate with a damnèd pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport 
 
O bind him bind him Let him not come near me 
 
More company The fiend is strong within him 
 
Ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks 
 

 

 
What will you murder me Thou jailer thou I am thy prisoner Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue 
 
Masters let him go He is my prisoner and you shall not have him 
 
Go bind this man for he is frantic too 
 
What wilt thou do thou peevish officer Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself 
 
He is my prisoner If I let him go The debt he owes will be required of me 
 
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee Bear me forthwith unto his creditor And knowing how the debt grows I will pay it Good Master Doctor see him safe conveyed Home to my house O most unhappy day 
 

 

 
O most unhappy strumpet 
 

 

 
Master I am here entered in bond for you 
 

 

 
Out on thee villain Wherefore dost thou mad me 
 

 

 
Will you be bound for nothing Be mad good master Cry The devil 
 
God help poor souls How idly do they talk 
 
Go bear him hence Sister go you with me Say now whose suit is he arrested at 
 
One Angelo a goldsmith Do you know him 
 
I know the man What is the sum he owes 
 
Two hundred ducats 
 
Say how grows it due 
 
Due for a chain your husband had of him 
 
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not 
 
Whenas your husband all in rage today Came to my house and took away my ring The ring I saw upon his finger now Straight after did I meet him with a chain 
 
It may be so but I did never see it Come jailer bring me where the goldsmith is I long to know the truth hereof at large 
 
God for Thy mercy they are loose again 
 
And come with naked swords Let’s call more help To have them bound again 
 
Away They’ll kill us
