 
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip She is spherical like a globe I could find out countries in her 
 

 

 
In what part of her body stands Ireland 
 

 

 
Marry sir in her buttocks I found it out by the bogs 
 

 

 
Where Scotland 
 

 

 
I found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand 
 

 

 
Where France 
 

 

 
In her forehead armed and reverted making war against her heir 
 

 

 
Where England 
 

 

 
I looked for the chalky cliffs but I could find no whiteness in them But I guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and it 
 

 

 
Where Spain 
 

 

 
Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in her breath 
 

 

 
Where America the Indies 
 

 

 
O sir upon her nose all o’erembellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadas of carracks to be ballast at her nose 
 

 

 
Where stood Belgia the Netherlands 
 

 

 
O sir I did not look so low To conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me called me Dromio swore I was assured to her told me what privy marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I amazed ran from her as a witch And I think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i’ th’ wheel 
 

 

 
Go hie thee presently Post to the road An if the wind blow any way from shore I will not harbor in this town tonight If any bark put forth come to the mart Where I will walk till thou return to me If everyone knows us and we know none ’Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone 
 

 

 
As from a bear a man would run for life So fly I from her that would be my wife
