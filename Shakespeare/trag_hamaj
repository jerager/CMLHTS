Look whe’er he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes Prithee no more 
 
’Tis well I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon Good my lord will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live 
 
My lord I will use them according to their desert 
 
God’s bodykins man much better Use every man after his desert and who shall ’scape whipping Use them after your own honor and dignity The less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty Take them in 
 
Come sirs 
 
Follow him friends We’ll hear a play tomorrow Dost thou hear me old friend Can you play The Murder of Gonzago 
 

 
Ay my lord 
 
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t could you not 
 

 
Ay my lord 
 
Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him not My good friends I’ll leave you till night You are welcome to Elsinore 
 
Good my lord 
 
Ay so good-bye to you Now I am alone O what a rogue and peasant slave am I Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a fiction in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wanned Tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect A broken voice and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit and all for nothing For Hecuba What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech Make mad the guilty and appall the free Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I A dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak Like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause And can say nothing no not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damned defeat was made Am I a coward Who calls me villain breaks my pate across Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i’ th’ throat As deep as to the lungs Who does me this Ha ’Swounds I should take it For it cannot be But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall To make oppression bitter or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave’s offal Bloody bawdy villain Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain O vengeance Why what an ass am I This is most brave That I the son of a dear father murdered Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell Must like a whore unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab A stallion Fie upon ’t Foh About my brains Hum I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimed their malefactions For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ I’ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle I’ll observe his looks I’ll tent him to the quick If he do blench I know my course The spirit that I have seen May be a devil and the devil hath power T’ assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy As he is very potent with such spirits Abuses me to damn me I’ll have grounds More relative than this The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King 
 
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy 
 
He does confess he feels himself distracted But from what cause he will by no means speak 
 
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state 
 
Did he receive you well 
 
Most like a gentleman 
 
But with much forcing of his disposition 
 
Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply 
 
Did you assay him to any pastime 
 
Madam it so fell out that certain players We o’erraught on the way Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it They are here about the court And as I think they have already order This night to play before him 
 
’Tis most true And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter 
 
With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his purpose into these delights 
 
We shall my lord 
 
Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither That he as ’twere by accident may here Affront Ophelia Her father and myself lawful espials Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him as he is behaved If ’t be th’ affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for 
 
I shall obey you And for your part Ophelia I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet’s wildness So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again To both your honors 
 
Madam I wish it may 
 
Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you We will bestow ourselves Read on this book That show of such an exercise may color Your loneliness We are oft to blame in this ’Tis too much proved that with devotion’s visage And pious action we do sugar o’er The devil himself 
 
O ’tis too true How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience The harlot’s cheek beautied with plast’ring art Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word O heavy burden 
 
I hear him coming Let’s withdraw my lord 
 
To be or not to be that is the question Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To die to sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished To die to sleep To sleep perchance to dream Ay there’s the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time Th’ oppressor’s wrong the proud man’s contumely The pangs of despised love the law’s delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action Soft you now The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered 
 
Good my lord How does your Honor for this many a day 
 
I humbly thank you well 
 
My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver I pray you now receive them 
 
No not I I never gave you aught 
 
My honored lord you know right well you did And with them words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich Their perfume lost Take these again for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind There my lord 
 
Ha ha are you honest 
 
My lord 
 
Are you fair 
 
What means your Lordship 
 
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty 
 
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty 
 
Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof I did love you once 
 
Indeed my lord you made me believe so 
 
You should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you not 
 
I was the more deceived 
 
Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery Where’s your father 
 
At home my lord
