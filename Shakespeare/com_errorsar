Master is this Mistress Satan 
 

 

 
It is the devil 
 

 

 
Nay she is worse she is the devil’s dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench And thereof comes that the wenches say God damn me that’s as much to say God make me a light wench It is written they appear to men like angels of light Light is an effect of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn Come not near her 
 
Your man and you are marvelous merry sir Will you go with me We’ll mend our dinner here 
 

 

 
Master if you do expect spoon meat or bespeak a long spoon 
 

 

 
Why Dromio 
 

 

 
Marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil 
 

 

 
Avoid then fiend What tell’st thou me of supping Thou art as you are all a sorceress I conjure thee to leave me and be gone 
 
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner Or for my diamond the chain you promised And I’ll be gone sir and not trouble you 
 

 

 
Some devils ask but the parings of one’s nail a rush a hair a drop of blood a pin a nut a cherrystone but she more covetous would have a chain Master be wise An if you give it her the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it 
 
I pray you sir my ring or else the chain I hope you do not mean to cheat me so 
 

 

 
Avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go 
 

 

 
Fly pride says the peacock Mistress that you know 
 
Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad Else would he never so demean himself A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats And for the same he promised me a chain Both one and other he denies me now The reason that I gather he is mad Besides this present instance of his rage Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance Belike his wife acquainted with his fits On purpose shut the doors against his way My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that being lunatic He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away This course I fittest choose For forty ducats is too much to lose 
 

 

 
Fear me not man I will not break away I’ll give thee ere I leave thee so much money To warrant thee as I am ’rested for My wife is in a wayward mood today And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attached in Ephesus I tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears Here comes my man I think he brings the money How now sir Have you that I sent you for 
 

 

 
Here’s that I warrant you will pay them all 
 

 

 
But where’s the money 
 

 

 
Why sir I gave the money for the rope 
 

 

 
Five hundred ducats villain for a rope 
 

 

 
I’ll serve you sir five hundred at the rate
