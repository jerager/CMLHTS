Sir amen 
 
Stands Scotland where it did 
 
Alas poor country Almost afraid to know itself It cannot Be called our mother but our grave where nothing But who knows nothing is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air Are made not marked where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy The dead man’s knell Is there scarce asked for who and good men’s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps Dying or ere they sicken 
 
O relation too nice and yet too true 
 
What’s the newest grief 
 
That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker Each minute teems a new one 
 
How does my wife 
 
Why well 
 
And all my children 
 
Well too 
 
The tyrant has not battered at their peace 
 
No they were well at peace when I did leave ’em 
 
Be not a niggard of your speech How goes ’t 
 
When I came hither to transport the tidings Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out Which was to my belief witnessed the rather For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot Now is the time of help Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers make our women fight To doff their dire distresses 
 
Be ’t their comfort We are coming thither Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out 
 
Would I could answer This comfort with the like But I have words That would be howled out in the desert air Where hearing should not latch them 
 
What concern they The general cause or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast 
 
No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe though the main part Pertains to you alone 
 
If it be mine Keep it not from me Quickly let me have it 
 
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard 
 
Hum I guess at it 
 
Your castle is surprised your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered To relate the manner Were on the quarry of these murdered deer To add the death of you 
 
Merciful heaven What man ne’er pull your hat upon your brows Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break 
 
My children too 
 
Wife children servants all that could be found 
 
And I must be from thence My wife killed too 
 
I have said 
 
Be comforted Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge To cure this deadly grief 
 
He has no children All my pretty ones Did you say all O hell-kite All What all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop 
 
Dispute it like a man 
 
I shall do so But I must also feel it as a man I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me Did heaven look on And would not take their part Sinful Macduff They were all struck for thee Naught that I am Not for their own demerits but for mine Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now 
 
Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief Convert to anger Blunt not the heart enrage it 
 
O I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens Cut short all intermission Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself Within my sword’s length set him If he ’scape Heaven forgive him too 
 
This tune goes manly Come go we to the King Our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth Is ripe for shaking and the powers above Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may The night is long that never finds the day 
 
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report When was it she last walked 
 
Since his Majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon ’t read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep 
 
A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this slumb’ry agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say 
 
That sir which I will not report after her 
 
You may to me and ’tis most meet you should 
 
Neither to you nor anyone having no witness to confirm my speech Lo you here she comes This is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep Observe her stand close 
 
How came she by that light 
 
Why it stood by her She has light by her continually ’Tis her command 
 
You see her eyes are open 
 
Ay but their sense are shut 
 
What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands 
 
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour 
 

 
Yet here’s a spot 
 
Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
