 
Nay he’s at two hands with me and that my two ears can witness 
 
Say didst thou speak with him Know’st thou his mind 
 

 

 
Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it 
 
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning 
 

 

 
Nay he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them 
 
But say I prithee is he coming home It seems he hath great care to please his wife 
 

 

 
Why mistress sure my master is horn mad 
 
Horn mad thou villain 
 

 

 
I mean not cuckold mad But sure he is stark mad When I desired him to come home to dinner He asked me for a thousand marks in gold ’Tis dinnertime quoth I My gold quoth he Your meat doth burn quoth I My gold quoth he Will you come quoth I My gold quoth he Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain The pig quoth I is burned My gold quoth he My mistress sir quoth I Hang up thy mistress I know not thy mistress Out on thy mistress 
 
Quoth who 
 

 

 
Quoth my master I know quoth he no house no wife no mistress So that my errand due unto my tongue I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders For in conclusion he did beat me there 
 
Go back again thou slave and fetch him home 
 

 

 
Go back again and be new beaten home For God’s sake send some other messenger 
 
Back slave or I will break thy pate across 
 

 

 
And he will bless that cross with other beating Between you I shall have a holy head 
 
Hence prating peasant Fetch thy master home 
 

 

 
Am I so round with you as you with me That like a football you do spurn me thus You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither If I last in this service you must case me in leather 
 
Fie how impatience loureth in your face 
 
His company must do his minions grace Whilst I at home starve for a merry look Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took From my poor cheek Then he hath wasted it Are my discourses dull Barren my wit If voluble and sharp discourse be marred Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard Do their gay vestments his affections bait That’s not my fault he’s master of my state What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruined Then is he the ground Of my defeatures My decayèd fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But too unruly deer he breaks the pale And feeds from home Poor I am but his stale 
 
Self-harming jealousy fie beat it hence 
 
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense I know his eye doth homage otherwhere Or else what lets it but he would be here Sister you know he promised me a chain Would that alone o’ love he would detain So he would keep fair quarter with his bed I see the jewel best enamelèd Will lose his beauty Yet the gold bides still That others touch and often touching will Wear gold yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame Since that my beauty cannot please his eye I’ll weep what’s left away and weeping die 
 
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy 
 

 

 
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave Is wandered forth in care to seek me out By computation and mine host’s report I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart See here he comes How now sir Is your merry humor altered As you love strokes so jest with me again You know no Centaur You received no gold Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad That thus so madly thou didst answer me 
 

 

 
What answer sir When spake I such a word 
 

 

 
Even now even here not half an hour since
