Lower Hark again 
 
Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wronged you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood He followed you for love I followed him But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too And now so you will let me quiet go To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further Let me go You see how simple and how fond I am 
 
Why get you gone Who is ’t that hinders you 
 
A foolish heart that I leave here behind 
 
What with Lysander 
 
With Demetrius 
 
Be not afraid She shall not harm thee Helena 
 
No sir she shall not though you take her part 
 
O when she is angry she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school And though she be but little she is fierce 
 
Little again Nothing but low and little Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to her 
 
Get you gone you dwarf You minimus of hind’ring knotgrass made You bead you acorn 
 
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services Let her alone Speak not of Helena Take not her part For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her Thou shalt aby it 
 
Now she holds me not Now follow if thou dar’st to try whose right Of thine or mine is most in Helena 
 
Follow Nay I’ll go with thee cheek by jowl 
 
You mistress all this coil is long of you Nay go not back 
 
I will not trust you I Nor longer stay in your curst company Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray My legs are longer though to run away 
 
I am amazed and know not what to say 
 
This is thy negligence Still thou mistak’st Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully 
 
Believe me king of shadows I mistook Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport 
 
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight Hie therefore Robin overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight When they next wake all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision And back to Athens shall the lovers wend With league whose date till death shall never end Whiles I in this affair do thee employ I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmèd eye release From monster’s view and all things shall be peace 
 
My fairy lord this must be done with haste For night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger At whose approach ghosts wand’ring here and there Troop home to churchyards Damnèd spirits all That in crossways and floods have burial Already to their wormy beds are gone For fear lest day should look their shames upon They willfully themselves exile from light And must for aye consort with black-browed night 
 
But we are spirits of another sort I with the Morning’s love have oft made sport And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate all fiery red Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams But notwithstanding haste Make no delay We may effect this business yet ere day 
 
Up and down up and down I will lead them up and down I am feared in field and town Goblin lead them up and down Here comes one 
 
Where art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now 
 
Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou 
 
I will be with thee straight 
 
Follow me then to plainer ground 
 
Lysander speak again Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head 
 
Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars And wilt not come Come recreant Come thou child I’ll whip thee with a rod He is defiled That draws a sword on thee 
 
Yea art thou there 
 
Follow my voice We’ll try no manhood here 
 
He goes before me and still dares me on When I come where he calls then he is gone The villain is much lighter-heeled than I I followed fast but faster he did fly That fallen am I in dark uneven way And here will rest me Come thou gentle day For if but once thou show me thy gray light I’ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite 
 
Ho ho ho Coward why com’st thou not 
 
Abide me if thou dar’st for well I wot Thou runn’st before me shifting every place And dar’st not stand nor look me in the face Where art thou now 
 
Come hither I am here 
 
Nay then thou mock’st me Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed By day’s approach look to be visited 
 
O weary night O long and tedious night Abate thy hours Shine comforts from the east That I may back to Athens by daylight From these that my poor company detest And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye Steal me awhile from mine own company 
 
Yet but three Come one more Two of both kinds makes up four Here she comes curst and sad Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad 
 
Never so weary never so in woe Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers I can no further crawl no further go My legs can keep no pace with my desires Here will I rest me till the break of day Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray 
 
On the ground Sleep sound I’ll apply To your eye Gentle lover remedy When thou wak’st Thou tak’st True delight In the sight Of thy former lady’s eye And the country proverb known That every man should take his own In your waking shall be shown Jack shall have Jill Naught shall go ill The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well 
 
Come sit thee down upon this flow’ry bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head And kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy 
 
Where’s Peaseblossom 
 
Ready
