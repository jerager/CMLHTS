By th’ Mass and ’tis like a camel indeed 
 
Methinks it is like a weasel 
 
It is backed like a weasel 
 
Or like a whale 
 
Very like a whale 
 
Then I will come to my mother by and by They fool me to the top of my bent I will come by and by 
 
I will say so 
 
By and by is easily said Leave me friends ’Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother O heart lose not thy nature let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom Let me be cruel not unnatural I will speak daggers to her but use none My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites How in my words somever she be shent To give them seals never my soul consent 
 
I like him not nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range Therefore prepare you I your commission will forthwith dispatch And he to England shall along with you The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow Out of his brows 
 
We will ourselves provide Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty 
 
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armor of the mind To keep itself from noyance but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many The cess of majesty Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw What’s near it with it or it is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined which when it falls Each small annexment petty consequence Attends the boist’rous ruin Never alone Did the king sigh but with a general groan 
 
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage For we will fetters put about this fear Which now goes too free-footed 
 
We will haste us 
 
My lord he’s going to his mother’s closet Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home And as you said and wisely was it said ’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother Since nature makes them partial should o’erhear The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know 
 
Thanks dear my lord O my offense is rank it smells to heaven It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t A brother’s murder Pray can I not Though inclination be as sharp as will My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent And like a man to double business bound I stand in pause where I shall first begin And both neglect What if this cursèd hand Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offense And what’s in prayer but this twofold force To be forestallèd ere we come to fall Or pardoned being down Then I’ll look up My fault is past But O what form of prayer Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder That cannot be since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder My crown mine own ambition and my queen May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law But ’tis not so above There is no shuffling there the action lies In his true nature and we ourselves compelled Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults To give in evidence What then What rests Try what repentance can What can it not Yet what can it when one cannot repent O wretched state O bosom black as death O limèd soul that struggling to be free Art more engaged Help angels Make assay Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe All may be well 
 
Now might I do it pat now he is a-praying And now I’ll do ’t And so he goes to heaven And so am I revenged That would be scanned A villain kills my father and for that I his sole son do this same villain send To heaven Why this is hire and salary not revenge He took my father grossly full of bread With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May And how his audit stands who knows save heaven But in our circumstance and course of thought ’Tis heavy with him And am I then revenged To take him in the purging of his soul When he is fit and seasoned for his passage No Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunk asleep or in his rage Or in th’ incestuous pleasure of his bed At game a-swearing or about some act That has no relish of salvation in ’t Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell whereto it goes My mother stays This physic but prolongs thy sickly days 
 
My words fly up my thoughts remain below Words without thoughts never to heaven go 
 
He will come straight Look you lay home to him Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with And that your Grace hath screened and stood between Much heat and him I’ll silence me even here Pray you be round with him 
 
Mother mother mother 
 
I’ll warrant you Fear me not Withdraw I hear him coming 
 
Now mother what’s the matter 
 
Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended 
 
Mother you have my father much offended 
 
Come come you answer with an idle tongue 
 
Go go you question with a wicked tongue 
 
Why how now Hamlet 
 
What’s the matter now 
 
Have you forgot me 
 
No by the rood not so You are the Queen your husband’s brother’s wife And would it were not so you are my mother 
 
Nay then I’ll set those to you that can speak 
 
Come come and sit you down you shall not budge You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you 
 
What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murder me Help ho 
 
What ho Help 
 
How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead 
 
O I am slain 
 
O me what hast thou done 
 
Nay I know not Is it the King 
 
O what a rash and bloody deed is this 
 
A bloody deed almost as bad good mother As kill a king and marry with his brother 
 
As kill a king 
 
Ay lady it was my word Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger Leave wringing of your hands Peace sit you down And let me wring your heart for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuff If damnèd custom have not brazed it so That it be proof and bulwark against sense 
 
What have I done that thou dar’st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me 
 
Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there makes marriage vows As false as dicers’ oaths O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words Heaven’s face does glow O’er this solidity and compound mass With heated visage as against the doom Is thought-sick at the act 
 
Ay me what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index 
 
Look here upon this picture and on this The counterfeit presentment of two brothers See what a grace was seated on this brow Hyperion’s curls the front of Jove himself An eye like Mars’ to threaten and command A station like the herald Mercury New-lighted on a heaven -kissing hill A combination and a form indeed Where every god did seem to set his seal To give the world assurance of a man This was your husband Look you now what follows Here is your husband like a mildewed ear Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor Ha Have you eyes You cannot call it love for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame it’s humble And waits upon the judgment and what judgment Would step from this to this Sense sure you have Else could you not have motion but sure that sense Is apoplexed for madness would not err Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled But it reserved some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference What devil was ’t That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind Eyes without feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardor gives the charge Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will 
 
O Hamlet speak no more Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul And there I see such black and grainèd spots As will not leave their tinct 
 
Nay but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed Stewed in corruption honeying and making love Over the nasty sty 
 
O speak to me no more These words like daggers enter in my ears No more sweet Hamlet 
 
A murderer and a villain A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord a vice of kings A cutpurse of the empire and the rule That from a shelf the precious diadem stole And put it in his pocket 
 
No more
