 

 
When shall we three meet again In thunder lightning or in rain 
 

 
When the hurly-burly’s done When the battle’s lost and won 
 

 
That will be ere the set of sun 
 

 
Where the place 
 

 
Upon the heath 
 

 
There to meet with Macbeth 
 

 
I come Graymalkin 
 

 
Paddock calls 
 

 
Anon 
 
Fair is foul and foul is fair Hover through the fog and filthy air 
 
What bloody man is that He can report As seemeth by his plight of the revolt The newest state 
 
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought ’Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it 
 
Doubtful it stood As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald Worthy to be a rebel for to that The multiplying villainies of nature Do swarm upon him from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied And Fortune on his damnèd quarrel smiling Showed like a rebel’s whore But all’s too weak For brave Macbeth well he deserves that name Disdaining Fortune with his brandished steel Which smoked with bloody execution Like Valor’s minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave Which ne’er shook hands nor bade farewell to him Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops And fixed his head upon our battlements 
 
O valiant cousin worthy gentleman 
 
As whence the sun ’gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come Discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark No sooner justice had with valor armed Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage With furbished arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault 
 
Dismayed not this our captains Macbeth and Banquo 
 
Yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion If I say sooth I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds Or memorize another Golgotha I cannot tell But I am faint My gashes cry for help 
 
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds They smack of honor both Go get him surgeons Who comes here 
 
The worthy Thane of Ross 
 
What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look that seems to speak things strange 
 
God save the King 
 
Whence cam’st thou worthy thane 
 
From Fife great king Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold Norway himself with terrible numbers Assisted by that most disloyal traitor The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict Till that Bellona’s bridegroom lapped in proof Confronted him with self-comparisons Point against point rebellious arm ’gainst arm Curbing his lavish spirit And to conclude The victory fell on us 
 
Great happiness 
 
That now Sweno The Norways’ king craves composition Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursèd at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use 
 
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death And with his former title greet Macbeth 
 
I’ll see it done 
 
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won 
 

 
Where hast thou been sister 
 

 
Killing swine 
 

 
Sister where thou 
 

 
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap And munched and munched and munched Give me quoth I Aroint thee witch the rump-fed runnion cries Her husband’s to Aleppo gone master o’ th’ Tiger But in a sieve I’ll thither sail And like a rat without a tail I’ll do I’ll do and I’ll do 
 

 
I’ll give thee a wind 
 

 
Th’ art kind
