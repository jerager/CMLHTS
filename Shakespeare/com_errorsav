 

 
I see these witches are afraid of swords 
 

 

 
She that would be your wife now ran from you 
 

 

 
Come to the Centaur Fetch our stuff from thence I long that we were safe and sound aboard 
 

 

 
Faith stay here this night They will surely do us no harm You saw they speak us fair give us gold Methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch 
 

 

 
I will not stay tonight for all the town Therefore away to get our stuff aboard 
 
I am sorry sir that I have hindered you But I protest he had the chain of me Though most dishonestly he doth deny it 
 

 
How is the man esteemed here in the city 
 
Of very reverend reputation sir Of credit infinite highly beloved Second to none that lives here in the city His word might bear my wealth at any time 
 

 
Speak softly Yonder as I think he walks 
 
’Tis so and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have Good sir draw near to me I’ll speak to him Signior Antipholus I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble And not without some scandal to yourself With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain which now you wear so openly Besides the charge the shame imprisonment You have done wrong to this my honest friend Who but for staying on our controversy Had hoisted sail and put to sea today This chain you had of me Can you deny it 
 

 

 
I think I had I never did deny it 
 

 
Yes that you did sir and forswore it too 
 

 

 
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it 
 

 
These ears of mine thou know’st did hear thee Fie on thee wretch ’Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort 
 

 

 
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand 
 

 
I dare and do defy thee for a villain 
 
Hold hurt him not for God’s sake He is mad Some get within him take his sword away Bind Dromio too and bear them to my house 
 

 

 
Run master run For God’s sake take a house This is some priory In or we are spoiled 
 
Be quiet people Wherefore throng you hither 
 
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence Let us come in that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery 
 
I knew he was not in his perfect wits 
 

 
I am sorry now that I did draw on him 
 
How long hath this possession held the man 
 
This week he hath been heavy sour sad And much different from the man he was But till this afternoon his passion Ne’er brake into extremity of rage 
 
Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye Strayed his affection in unlawful love A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing Which of these sorrows is he subject to 
 
To none of these except it be the last Namely some love that drew him oft from home
