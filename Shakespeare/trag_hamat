Who is to be buried in ’t 
 
One that was a woman sir but rest her soul she’s dead 
 
How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio this three years I have took note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe How long hast thou been grave-maker 
 
Of all the days i’ th’ year I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras 
 
How long is that since 
 
Cannot you tell that Every fool can tell that It was that very day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into England 
 
Ay marry why was he sent into England 
 
Why because he was mad He shall recover his wits there Or if he do not ’tis no great matter there 
 
Why 
 
’Twill not be seen in him there There the men are as mad as he 
 
How came he mad 
 
Very strangely they say 
 
How strangely 
 
Faith e’en with losing his wits 
 
Upon what ground 
 
Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and boy thirty years 
 
How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot 
 
Faith if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year A tanner will last you nine year 
 
Why he more than another 
 
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earth three-and-twenty years 
 
Whose was it 
 
A whoreson mad fellow’s it was Whose do you think it was 
 
Nay I know not 
 
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull sir was sir Yorick’s skull the King’s jester 
 
This 
 
E’en that 
 
Let me see Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy He hath bore me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft Where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your own grinning Quite chapfallen Now get you to my lady’s chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come Make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell me one thing 
 
What’s that my lord 
 
Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’ earth 
 
E’en so 
 
And smelt so Pah 
 
E’en so my lord 
 
To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole 
 
’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so 
 
No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died Alexander was buried Alexander returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away O that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t’ expel the winter’s flaw But soft but soft awhile Here comes the King The Queen the courtiers Who is this they follow And with such maimèd rites This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desp’rate hand Fordo its own life ’Twas of some estate Couch we awhile and mark 
 
What ceremony else 
 
That is Laertes a very noble youth Mark 
 
What ceremony else 
 
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty Her death was doubtful And but that great command o’ersways the order She should in ground unsanctified been lodged Till the last trumpet For charitable prayers Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial 
 
Must there no more be done 
 
No more be done We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls 
 
Lay her i’ th’ earth And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest A minist’ring angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling 
 
What the fair Ophelia 
 
Sweets to the sweet farewell I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife I thought thy bride-bed to have decked sweet maid And not have strewed thy grave 
 
O treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of this flat a mountain you have made T’ o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus 
 
What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wand’ring stars and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers This is I Hamlet the Dane 
 
The devil take thy soul 
 
Thou pray’st not well I prithee take thy fingers from my throat For though I am not splenitive and rash Yet have I in me something dangerous Which let thy wisdom fear Hold off thy hand 
 
Pluck them asunder 
 
Hamlet Hamlet
