Master knock the door hard 
 
Let him knock till it ache 
 

 

 
You’ll cry for this minion if I beat the door down 
 
What needs all that and a pair of stocks in the town 
 
Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise 
 

 

 
By my troth your town is troubled with unruly boys 
 

 

 
Are you there wife You might have come before 
 
Your wife sir knave Go get you from the door 
 

 

 
If you went in pain master this knave would go sore 
 
Here is neither cheer sir nor welcome We would fain have either 
 
In debating which was best we shall part with neither 
 

 

 
They stand at the door master Bid them welcome hither 
 

 

 
There is something in the wind that we cannot get in 
 

 

 
You would say so master if your garments were thin Your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold 
 

 

 
Go fetch me something I’ll break ope the gate 
 

 

 
Break any breaking here and I’ll break your knave’s pate 
 

 

 
A man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind Ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind 
 

 

 
It seems thou want’st breaking Out upon thee hind 
 

 

 
Here’s too much Out upon thee I pray thee let me in 
 

 

 
Ay when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin 
 

 

 
Well I’ll break in Go borrow me a crow
