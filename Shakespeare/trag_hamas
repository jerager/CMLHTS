Let’s follow Gertrude How much I had to do to calm his rage Now fear I this will give it start again Therefore let’s follow 
 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation 
 
I tell thee she is Therefore make her grave straight The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial 
 
How can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defense 
 
Why ’tis found so 
 
It must be se offendendo it cannot be else For here lies the point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do to perform Argal she drowned herself wittingly 
 
Nay but hear you goodman delver 
 
Give me leave Here lies the water good Here stands the man good If the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes mark you that But if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself Argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life 
 
But is this law 
 
Ay marry is ’t crowner’s ’quest law 
 
Will you ha’ the truth on ’t If this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial 
 
Why there thou sayst And the more pity that great folk should have count’nance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even-Christian Come my spade There is no ancient gentlemen but gard’ners ditchers and grave-makers They hold up Adam’s profession 
 
Was he a gentleman 
 
He was the first that ever bore arms 
 
Why he had none 
 
What art a heathen How dost thou understand the scripture The scripture says Adam digged Could he dig without arms I’ll put another question to thee If thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself 
 
Go to 
 
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter 
 
The gallows-maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants 
 
I like thy wit well in good faith The gallows does well But how does it well It does well to those that do ill Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church Argal the gallows may do well to thee To ’t again come 
 
Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenter 
 
Ay tell me that and unyoke 
 
Marry now I can tell 
 
To ’t 
 
Mass I cannot tell 
 
Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating And when you are asked this question next say a grave-maker The houses he makes lasts till doomsday Go get thee in and fetch me a stoup of liquor In youth when I did love did love Methought it was very sweet To contract O the time for a my behove O methought there a was nothing a meet 
 
Has this fellow no feeling of his business He sings in grave-making 
 
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness 
 
’Tis e’en so The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense 
 
But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch And hath shipped me into the land As if I had never been such 
 
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once How the knave jowls it to the ground as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone that did the first murder This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’erreaches one that would circumvent God might it not 
 
It might my lord 
 
Or of a courtier which could say Good morrow sweet lord How dost thou sweet lord This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it might it not 
 
Ay my lord 
 
Why e’en so And now my Lady Worm’s chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade Here’s fine revolution an we had the trick to see ’t Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them Mine ache to think on ’t 
 
A pickax and a spade a spade For and a shrouding sheet O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet 
 
There’s another Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer Where be his quiddities now his quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks Why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery Hum this fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th’ inheritor himself have no more ha 
 
Not a jot more my lord 
 
Is not parchment made of sheepskins 
 
Ay my lord and of calves’ skins too 
 
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I will speak to this fellow Whose grave’s this sirrah 
 
Mine sir O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet 
 
I think it be thine indeed for thou liest in ’t 
 
You lie out on ’t sir and therefore ’tis not yours For my part I do not lie in ’t yet it is mine 
 
Thou dost lie in ’t to be in ’t and say it is thine ’Tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest 
 
’Tis a quick lie sir ’twill away again from me to you 
 
What man dost thou dig it for 
 
For no man sir 
 
What woman then 
 
For none neither
