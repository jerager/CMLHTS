I did not see you since you sent me hence Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me 
 

 

 
Villain thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeased 
 

 

 
I am glad to see you in this merry vein What means this jest I pray you master tell me 
 

 

 
Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth Think’st thou I jest Hold take thou that and that 
 

 

 
Hold sir for God’s sake Now your jest is earnest Upon what bargain do you give it me 
 

 

 
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport But creep in crannies when he hides his beams If you will jest with me know my aspect And fashion your demeanor to my looks Or I will beat this method in your sconce 
 

 

 
Sconce call you it So you would leave battering I had rather have it a head An you use these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders But I pray sir why am I beaten 
 

 

 
Dost thou not know 
 

 

 
Nothing sir but that I am beaten 
 

 

 
Shall I tell you why 
 

 

 
Ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore 
 

 

 
Why first for flouting me and then wherefore for urging it the second time to me 
 

 

 
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason Well sir I thank you 
 

 

 
Thank me sir for what 
 

 

 
Marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing 
 

 

 
I’ll make you amends next to give you nothing for something But say sir is it dinnertime 
 

 

 
No sir I think the meat wants that I have
