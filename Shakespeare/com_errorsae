 
In good time sir what’s that 
 

 

 
Basting 
 

 

 
Well sir then ’twill be dry 
 

 

 
If it be sir I pray you eat none of it 
 

 

 
Your reason 
 

 

 
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting 
 

 

 
Well sir learn to jest in good time There’s a time for all things 
 

 

 
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric 
 

 

 
By what rule sir 
 

 

 
Marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself 
 

 

 
Let’s hear it 
 

 

 
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature 
 

 

 
May he not do it by fine and recovery 
 

 

 
Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man 
 

 

 
Why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement 
 

 

 
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit 
 

 

 
Why but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit
