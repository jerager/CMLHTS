Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house Farewell 
 
O help him you sweet heavens 
 
If thou dost marry I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a nunnery farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too Farewell 
 
Heavenly powers restore him 
 
I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another You jig and amble and you lisp you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance Go to I’ll no more on ’t It hath made me mad I say we will have no more marriage Those that are married already all but one shall live The rest shall keep as they are To a nunnery go 
 
O what a noble mind is here o’erthrown The courtier’s soldier’s scholar’s eye tongue sword Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state The glass of fashion and the mold of form Th’ observed of all observers quite quite down And I of ladies most deject and wretched That sucked the honey of his musicked vows Now see that noble and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled out of time and harsh That unmatched form and stature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me T’ have seen what I have seen see what I see 
 
Love His affections do not that way tend Nor what he spake though it lacked form a little Was not like madness There’s something in his soul O’er which his melancholy sits on brood And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent I have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself What think you on ’t 
 
It shall do well But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said We heard it all My lord do as you please But if you hold it fit after the play Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him To show his grief Let her be round with him And I’ll be placed so please you in the ear Of all their conference If she find him not To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think 
 
It shall be so Madness in great ones must not unwatched go 
 
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant It out-Herods Herod Pray you avoid it 
 
I warrant your Honor 
 
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theater of others O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably 
 
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir 
 
O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go make you ready How now my lord will the King hear this piece of work 
 
And the Queen too and that presently 
 
Bid the players make haste Will you two help to hasten them 
 
Ay my lord 
 
What ho Horatio 
 
Here sweet lord at your service 
 
Horatio thou art e’en as just a man As e’er my conversation coped withal 
 
O my dear lord 
 
Nay do not think I flatter For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flattered No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election Hath sealed thee for herself For thou hast been As one in suffering all that suffers nothing A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta’en with equal thanks and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please Give me that man That is not passion’s slave and I will wear him In my heart’s core ay in my heart of heart As I do thee Something too much of this There is a play tonight before the King One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father’s death I prithee when thou seest that act afoot Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan’s stithy Give him heedful note For I mine eyes will rivet to his face And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming 
 
Well my lord If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing And ’scape detecting I will pay the theft 
 
They are coming to the play I must be idle Get you a place 
 
How fares our cousin Hamlet 
 
Excellent i’ faith of the chameleon’s dish I eat the air promise-crammed You cannot feed capons so 
 
I have nothing with this answer Hamlet These words are not mine 
 
No nor mine now My lord you played once i’ th’ university you say 
 
That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor 
 
What did you enact 
 
I did enact Julius Caesar I was killed i’ th’ Capitol Brutus killed me 
 
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there Be the players ready 
 
Ay my lord They stay upon your patience 
 
Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me 
 
No good mother Here’s metal more attractive 
 
Oh ho Do you mark that 
 
Lady shall I lie in your lap 
 
No my lord 
 
I mean my head upon your lap 
 
Ay my lord 
 
Do you think I meant country matters 
 
I think nothing my lord 
 
That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs 
 
What is my lord 
 
Nothing 
 
You are merry my lord 
 
Who I 
 
Ay my lord 
 
O God your only jig-maker What should a man do but be merry For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within ’s two hours 
 
Nay ’tis twice two months my lord
