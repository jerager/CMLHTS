Not know my voice O time’s extremity Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow And all the conduits of my blood froze up Yet hath my night of life some memory My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left My dull deaf ears a little use to hear All these old witnesses I cannot err Tell me thou art my son Antipholus 
 

 

 
I never saw my father in my life 
 
But seven years since in Syracusa boy Thou know’st we parted But perhaps my son Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery 
 

 

 
The Duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life 
 
I tell thee Syracusian twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa I see thy age and dangers make thee dote 
 
Most mighty duke behold a man much wronged 
 
I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me 
 
One of these men is genius to the other And so of these which is the natural man And which the spirit Who deciphers them 
 

 

 
I sir am Dromio Command him away 
 

 

 
I sir am Dromio Pray let me stay 
 

 

 
Egeon art thou not or else his ghost 
 

 

 
O my old master Who hath bound him here 
 
Whoever bound him I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty Speak old Egeon if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons O if thou be’st the same Egeon speak And speak unto the same Emilia 
 
Why here begins his morning story right These two Antipholus’ these two so like And these two Dromios one in semblance Besides her urging of her wrack at sea These are the parents to these children Which accidentally are met together 
 
If I dream not thou art Emilia If thou art she tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft 
 
By men of Epidamium he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamium What then became of them I cannot tell I to this fortune that you see me in 
 
Antipholus thou cam’st from Corinth first 
 

 

 
No sir not I I came from Syracuse 
 
Stay stand apart I know not which is which 
 

 

 
I came from Corinth my most gracious lord 
 

 

 
And I with him 
 

 

 
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon your most renownèd uncle 
 
Which of you two did dine with me today 
 

 

 
I gentle mistress 
 
And are not you my husband 
 

 

 
No I say nay to that
