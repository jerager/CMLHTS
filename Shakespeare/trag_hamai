I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation 
 
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city Are they so followed 
 
No indeed are they not 
 
How comes it Do they grow rusty 
 
Nay their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace But there is sir an aerie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither 
 
What are they children Who maintains ’em How are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession 
 
Faith there has been much to-do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question 
 
Is ’t possible 
 
O there has been much throwing about of brains 
 
Do the boys carry it away 
 
Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too 
 
It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little ’Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out 
 
There are the players 
 
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands come then Th’ appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours You are welcome But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived 
 
In what my dear lord 
 
I am but mad north-north-west When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw 
 
Well be with you gentlemen 
 
Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts 
 
Haply he is the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child 
 
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it You say right sir a Monday morning ’twas then indeed 
 
My lord I have news to tell you 
 
My lord I have news to tell you when Roscius was an actor in Rome 
 
The actors are come hither my lord 
 
Buzz buzz 
 
Upon my honor 
 
Then came each actor on his ass 
 
The best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light For the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men 
 
O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou 
 
What a treasure had he my lord 
 
Why One fair daughter and no more The which he lovèd passing well 
 
Still on my daughter 
 
Am I not i’ th’ right old Jephthah 
 
If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well 
 
Nay that follows not 
 
What follows then my lord 
 
Why As by lot God wot and then you know It came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old friend Why thy face is valanced since I saw thee last Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark What my young lady and mistress By ’r Lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring Masters you are all welcome We’ll e’en to ’t like French falconers fly at anything we see We’ll have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your quality Come a passionate speech 
 

 
What speech my good lord 
 
I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million ’twas caviary to the general But it was as I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One speech in ’t I chiefly loved ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam’s slaughter If it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see The rugged Pyrrhus like th’ Hyrcanian beast ’tis not so it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms Black as his purpose did the night resemble When he lay couchèd in th’ ominous horse Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared With heraldry more dismal Head to foot Now is he total gules horridly tricked With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons Baked and impasted with the parching streets That lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light To their lord’s murder Roasted in wrath and fire And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks So proceed you 
 
’Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion 
 

 
Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls Repugnant to command Unequal matched Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Th’ unnervèd father falls Then senseless Ilium Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear For lo his sword Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam seemed i’ th’ air to stick So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood And like a neutral to his will and matter Did nothing But as we often see against some storm A silence in the heavens the rack stand still The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus’ pause Arousèd vengeance sets him new a-work And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall On Mars’s armor forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword Now falls on Priam Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods In general synod take away her power Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven As low as to the fiends 
 
This is too long 
 
It shall to the barber’s with your beard Prithee say on He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba 
 

 
But who ah woe had seen the moblèd queen 
 
The moblèd queen 
 
That’s good Moblèd queen is good 
 

 
Run barefoot up and down threat’ning the flames With bisson rheum a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood and for a robe About her lank and all o’erteemèd loins A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up Who this had seen with tongue in venom steeped ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounced But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs The instant burst of clamor that she made Unless things mortal move them not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And passion in the gods
