I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus 
 
O wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so 
 
Stay on thy peril I alone will go 
 
O I am out of breath in this fond chase The more my prayer the lesser is my grace Happy is Hermia wheresoe’er she lies For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears If so my eyes are oftener washed than hers No no I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do as a monster fly my presence thus What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne But who is here Lysander on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound Lysander if you live good sir awake 
 
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake Transparent Helena Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart Where is Demetrius O how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword 
 
Do not say so Lysander say not so What though he love your Hermia Lord what though Yet Hermia still loves you Then be content 
 
Content with Hermia No I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent Not Hermia but Helena I love Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason swayed And reason says you are the worthier maid Things growing are not ripe until their season So I being young till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes where I o’erlook Love’s stories written in love’s richest book 
 
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Is ’t not enough is ’t not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo But fare you well Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness O that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused 
 
She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings Or as the heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive So thou my surfeit and my heresy Of all be hated but the most of me And all my powers address your love and might To honor Helen and to be her knight 
 
Help me Lysander help me Do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast Ay me for pity What a dream was here Lysander look how I do quake with fear Methought a serpent ate my heart away And you sat smiling at his cruel prey Lysander What removed Lysander lord What out of hearing Gone No sound no word Alack where are you Speak an if you hear Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear No Then I well perceive you are not nigh Either death or you I’ll find immediately 
 
Are we all met 
 
Pat pat And here’s a marvels convenient place for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring-house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke 
 
Peter Quince 
 
What sayest thou bully Bottom 
 
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide How answer you that 
 
By ’r lakin a parlous fear 
 
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done 
 
Not a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed And for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver This will put them out of fear 
 
Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six 
 
No make it two more Let it be written in eight and eight 
 
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion 
 
I fear it I promise you 
 
Masters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in God shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to look to ’t 
 
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion 
 
Nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect Ladies or Fair ladies I would wish you or I would request you or I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble My life for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life No I am no such thing I am a man as other men are And there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner 
 
Well it shall be so But there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight 
 
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play 
 
A calendar a calendar Look in the almanac Find out moonshine find out moonshine 
 
Yes it doth shine that night 
 
Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement 
 
Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisbe says the story did talk through the chink of a wall 
 
You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom 
 
Some man or other must present Wall And let him have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast about him to signify wall or let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper 
 
If that may be then all is well Come sit down every mother’s son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin When you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so everyone according to his cue 
 
What hempen homespuns have we swagg’ring here So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen What a play toward I’ll be an auditor An actor too perhaps if I see cause 
 
Speak Pyramus Thisbe stand forth 
 
Thisbe the flowers of odious savors sweet 
 
Odors odors 
 
odors savors sweet So hath thy breath my dearest Thisbe dear But hark a voice Stay thou but here awhile And by and by I will to thee appear 
 
A stranger Pyramus than e’er played here 
 
Must I speak now 
 
Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again 
 
Most radiant Pyramus most lily-white of hue Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew As true as truest horse that yet would never tire I’ll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny’s tomb 
 
Ninus’ tomb man Why you must not speak that yet That you answer to Pyramus You speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramus enter Your cue is past It is never tire 
 
O As true as truest horse that yet would never tire 
 
If I were fair fair Thisbe I were only thine 
 
O monstrous O strange We are haunted Pray masters fly masters Help 
 
I’ll follow you I’ll lead you about a round Through bog through bush through brake through brier Sometime a horse I’ll be sometime a hound A hog a headless bear sometime a fire And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn 
 
Why do they run away This is a knavery of them to make me afeard 
 
O Bottom thou art changed What do I see on thee
