Hath he asked for me 
 

 
Know you not he has 
 
We will proceed no further in this business He hath honored me of late and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people Which would be worn now in their newest gloss Not cast aside so soon 
 

 
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself Hath it slept since And wakes it now to look so green and pale At what it did so freely From this time Such I account thy love Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem Letting I dare not wait upon I would Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage 
 
Prithee peace I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is none 
 

 
What beast was ’t then That made you break this enterprise to me When you durst do it then you were a man And to be more than what you were you would Be so much more the man Nor time nor place Did then adhere and yet you would make both They have made themselves and that their fitness now Does unmake you I have given suck and know How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me I would while it was smiling in my face Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums And dashed the brains out had I so sworn as you Have done to this 
 
If we should fail 
 

 
We fail But screw your courage to the sticking place And we’ll not fail When Duncan is asleep Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey Soundly invite him his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory the warder of the brain Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason A limbeck only When in swinish sleep Their drenchèd natures lies as in a death What cannot you and I perform upon Th’ unguarded Duncan What not put upon His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell 
 
Bring forth men-children only For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males Will it not be received When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers That they have done ’t 
 

 
Who dares receive it other As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar Upon his death 
 
I am settled and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat Away and mock the time with fairest show False face must hide what the false heart doth know 
 
How goes the night boy 
 
The moon is down I have not heard the clock 
 
And she goes down at twelve 
 
I take ’t ’tis later sir 
 
Hold take my sword There’s husbandry in heaven Their candles are all out Take thee that too A heavy summons lies like lead upon me And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose Give me my sword Who’s there 
 
A friend 
 
What sir not yet at rest The King’s abed He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices This diamond he greets your wife withal By the name of most kind hostess and shut up In measureless content 
 
Being unprepared Our will became the servant to defect Which else should free have wrought 
 
All’s well I dreamt last night of the three Weïrd Sisters To you they have showed some truth 
 
I think not of them Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve We would spend it in some words upon that business If you would grant the time 
 
At your kind’st leisure 
 
If you shall cleave to my consent when ’tis It shall make honor for you 
 
So I lose none In seeking to augment it but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear I shall be counseled 
 
Good repose the while 
 
Thanks sir The like to you 
 
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee I have thee not and yet I see thee still Art thou not fatal vision sensible To feeling as to sight Or art thou but A dagger of the mind a false creation Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain I see thee yet in form as palpable As this which now I draw Thou marshal’st me the way that I was going And such an instrument I was to use Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses Or else worth all the rest I see thee still And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood Which was not so before There’s no such thing It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes Now o’er the one-half world Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate’s off’rings and withered murder Alarumed by his sentinel the wolf Whose howl’s his watch thus with his stealthy pace With Tarquin’s ravishing strides towards his design Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firm-set earth Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts And take the present horror from the time Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives I go and it is done The bell invites me Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell 
 

 
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold What hath quenched them hath given me fire Hark Peace It was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman Which gives the stern’st good-night He is about it The doors are open and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores I have drugged their possets That death and nature do contend about them Whether they live or die 
 
Who’s there what ho 
 

 
Alack I am afraid they have awaked And ’tis not done Th’ attempt and not the deed Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready He could not miss ’em Had he not resembled My father as he slept I had done ’t My husband 
 
I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise 
 

 
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry Did not you speak 
 
When 
 

 
Now 
 
As I descended 
 

 
Ay 
 
Hark Who lies i’ th’ second chamber 
 

 
Donalbain 
 
This is a sorry sight
