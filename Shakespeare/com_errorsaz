 

 
And so do I yet did she call me so And this fair gentlewoman her sister here Did call me brother What I told you then I hope I shall have leisure to make good If this be not a dream I see and hear 
 
That is the chain sir which you had of me 
 

 

 
I think it be sir I deny it not 
 

 

 
And you sir for this chain arrested me 
 
I think I did sir I deny it not 
 
I sent you money sir to be your bail By Dromio but I think he brought it not 
 

 

 
No none by me 
 

 

 
This purse of ducats I received from you And Dromio my man did bring them me I see we still did meet each other’s man And I was ta’en for him and he for me And thereupon these errors are arose 
 

 

 
These ducats pawn I for my father here 
 
It shall not need Thy father hath his life 
 
Sir I must have that diamond from you 
 

 

 
There take it and much thanks for my good cheer 
 
Renownèd duke vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursèd all our fortunes And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error Have suffered wrong Go keep us company And we shall make full satisfaction Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you my sons and till this present hour My heavy burden ne’er deliverèd The Duke my husband and my children both And you the calendars of their nativity Go to a gossips’ feast and go with me After so long grief such nativity 
 
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast 
 

 

 
Master shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard 
 

 

 
Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarked 
 

 

 
Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur 
 

 

 
He speaks to me I am your master Dromio Come go with us We’ll look to that anon Embrace thy brother there Rejoice with him 
 

 

 
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner She now shall be my sister not my wife 
 

 

 
Methinks you are my glass and not my brother I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth Will you walk in to see their gossiping 
 

 

 
Not I sir You are my elder
