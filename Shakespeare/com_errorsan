Master Antipholus 
 

 

 
Ay that’s my name 
 
I know it well sir Lo here’s the chain I thought to have ta’en you at the Porpentine The chain unfinished made me stay thus long 
 

 

 
What is your will that I shall do with this 
 
What please yourself sir I have made it for you 
 

 

 
Made it for me sir I bespoke it not 
 
Not once nor twice but twenty times you have Go home with it and please your wife withal And soon at supper time I’ll visit you And then receive my money for the chain 
 

 

 
I pray you sir receive the money now For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more 
 
You are a merry man sir Fare you well 
 

 

 
What I should think of this I cannot tell But this I think there’s no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain I see a man here needs not live by shifts When in the streets he meets such golden gifts I’ll to the mart and there for Dromio stay If any ship put out then straight away 
 

 
You know since Pentecost the sum is due And since I have not much importuned you Nor now I had not but that I am bound To Persia and want guilders for my voyage Therefore make present satisfaction Or I’ll attach you by this officer 
 
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus And in the instant that I met with you He had of me a chain At five o’clock I shall receive the money for the same Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house I will discharge my bond and thank you too 
 
That labor may you save See where he comes 
 

 

 
While I go to the goldsmith’s house go thou And buy a rope’s end That will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day But soft I see the goldsmith Get thee gone Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me 
 

 

 
I buy a thousand pound a year I buy a rope 
 

 

 
A man is well holp up that trusts to you I promisèd your presence and the chain But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me Belike you thought our love would last too long If it were chained together and therefore came not 
 
Saving your merry humor here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman I pray you see him presently discharged For he is bound to sea and stays but for it 
 

 

 
I am not furnished with the present money Besides I have some business in the town Good signior take the stranger to my house And with you take the chain and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof Perchance I will be there as soon as you 
 
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself 
 

 

 
No bear it with you lest I come not time enough 
 
Well sir I will Have you the chain about you 
 

 

 
An if I have not sir I hope you have Or else you may return without your money 
 
Nay come I pray you sir give me the chain Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman And I to blame have held him here too long
