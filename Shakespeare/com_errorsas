 

 
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home 
 

 

 
To a rope’s end sir and to that end am I returned 
 

 

 
And to that end sir I will welcome you 
 
Good sir be patient 
 

 

 
Nay ’tis for me to be patient I am in adversity 
 
Good now hold thy tongue 
 

 

 
Nay rather persuade him to hold his hands 
 

 

 
Thou whoreson senseless villain 
 

 

 
I would I were senseless sir that I might not feel your blows 
 

 

 
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an ass 
 

 

 
I am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long ears I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows When I am cold he heats me with beating when I am warm he cools me with beating I am waked with it when I sleep raised with it when I sit driven out of doors with it when I go from home welcomed home with it when I return Nay I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door 
 

 

 
Come go along My wife is coming yonder 
 

 

 
Mistress respice finem respect your end or rather the prophecy like the parrot Beware the rope’s end 
 

 

 
Wilt thou still talk 
 
How say you now Is not your husband mad 
 
His incivility confirms no less Good Doctor Pinch you are a conjurer Establish him in his true sense again And I will please you what you will demand 
 
Alas how fiery and how sharp he looks 
 
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy 
 
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse 
 

 

 
There is my hand and let it feel your ear 
 
I charge thee Satan housed within this man To yield possession to my holy prayers And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven 
 

 

 
Peace doting wizard peace I am not mad
