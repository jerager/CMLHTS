Gentlemen 
 
Good my lord be quiet 
 
Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag 
 
O my son what theme 
 
I loved Ophelia Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her 
 
O he is mad Laertes 
 
For love of God forbear him 
 
’Swounds show me what thou ’t do Woo’t weep woo’t fight woo’t fast woo’t tear thyself Woo’t drink up eisel eat a crocodile I’ll do ’t Dost thou come here to whine To outface me with leaping in her grave Be buried quick with her and so will I And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us till our ground Singeing his pate against the burning zone Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou ’lt mouth I’ll rant as well as thou 
 
This is mere madness And thus awhile the fit will work on him Anon as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed His silence will sit drooping 
 
Hear you sir What is the reason that you use me thus I loved you ever But it is no matter Let Hercules himself do what he may The cat will mew and dog will have his day 
 
I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech We’ll put the matter to the present push Good Gertrude set some watch over your son This grave shall have a living monument An hour of quiet thereby shall we see Till then in patience our proceeding be 
 
So much for this sir Now shall you see the other You do remember all the circumstance 
 
Remember it my lord 
 
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly And praised be rashness for it let us know Our indiscretion sometime serves us well When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us There’s a divinity that shapes our ends Rough-hew them how we will 
 
That is most certain 
 
Up from my cabin My sea-gown scarfed about me in the dark Groped I to find out them had my desire Fingered their packet and in fine withdrew To mine own room again making so bold My fears forgetting manners to unfold Their grand commission where I found Horatio A royal knavery an exact command Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too With ho such bugs and goblins in my life That on the supervise no leisure bated No not to stay the grinding of the ax My head should be struck off 
 
Is ’t possible 
 
Here’s the commission Read it at more leisure But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed 
 
I beseech you 
 
Being thus benetted round with villainies Or I could make a prologue to my brains They had begun the play I sat me down Devised a new commission wrote it fair I once did hold it as our statists do A baseness to write fair and labored much How to forget that learning but sir now It did me yeoman’s service Wilt thou know Th’ effect of what I wrote 
 
Ay good my lord 
 
An earnest conjuration from the King As England was his faithful tributary As love between them like the palm might flourish As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma ’tween their amities And many suchlike as es of great charge That on the view and knowing of these contents Without debatement further more or less He should those bearers put to sudden death Not shriving time allowed 
 
How was this sealed 
 
Why even in that was heaven ordinant I had my father’s signet in my purse Which was the model of that Danish seal Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other Subscribed it gave ’t th’ impression placed it safely The changeling never known Now the next day Was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent Thou knowest already 
 
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t 
 
Why man they did make love to this employment They are not near my conscience Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites 
 
Why what a king is this 
 
Does it not think thee stand me now upon He that hath killed my king and whored my mother Popped in between th’ election and my hopes Thrown out his angle for my proper life And with such cozenage is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil 
 
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there 
 
It will be short The interim’s mine And a man’s life’s no more than to say one But I am very sorry good Horatio That to Laertes I forgot myself For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his I’ll court his favors But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a tow’ring passion 
 
Peace who comes here 
 
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark 
 
I humbly thank you sir Dost know this waterfly 
 
No my good lord 
 
Thy state is the more gracious for ’tis a vice to know him He hath much land and fertile Let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess ’Tis a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt 
 
Sweet lord if your Lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty 
 
I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit Put your bonnet to his right use ’tis for the head 
 
I thank your Lordship it is very hot 
 
No believe me ’tis very cold the wind is northerly 
 
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed 
 
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion 
 
Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as ’twere I cannot tell how My lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter 
 
I beseech you remember 
 
Nay good my lord for my ease in good faith Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see 
 
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more 
 
Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him 
 
The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath 
 
Sir 
 
Is ’t not possible to understand in another in another tongue You will to ’t sir really 
 
What imports the nomination of this gentleman
