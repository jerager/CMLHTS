 
A crow without feather Master mean you so For a fish without a fin there’s a fowl without a feather If a crow help us in sirrah well pluck a crow together 
 

 

 
Go get thee gone Fetch me an iron crow 
 
Have patience sir O let it not be so Herein you war against your reputation And draw within the compass of suspect Th’ unviolated honor of your wife Once this your long experience of her wisdom Her sober virtue years and modesty Plead on her part some cause to you unknown And doubt not sir but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you Be ruled by me depart in patience And let us to the Tiger all to dinner And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day A vulgar comment will be made of it And that supposèd by the common rout Against your yet ungallèd estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead For slander lives upon succession Forever housèd where it gets possession 
 

 

 
You have prevailed I will depart in quiet And in despite of mirth mean to be merry I know a wench of excellent discourse Pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle There will we dine This woman that I mean My wife but I protest without desert Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal To her will we to dinner Get you home And fetch the chain by this I know ’tis made Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine For there’s the house That chain will I bestow Be it for nothing but to spite my wife Upon mine hostess there Good sir make haste Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me I’ll knock elsewhere to see if they’ll disdain me 
 
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence 
 

 

 
Do so This jest shall cost me some expense 
 
And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband’s office Shall Antipholus Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot Shall love in building grow so ruinous If you did wed my sister for her wealth Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth Muffle your false love with some show of blindness Let not my sister read it in your eye Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator Look sweet speak fair become disloyalty Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint Be secret-false What need she be acquainted What simple thief brags of his own attaint ’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board Shame hath a bastard fame well managèd Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word Alas poor women make us but believe Being compact of credit that you love us Though others have the arm show us the sleeve We in your motion turn and you may move us Then gentle brother get you in again Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife ’Tis holy sport to be a little vain When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife 
 

 

 
Sweet mistress what your name is else I know not Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our Earth’s wonder more than Earth divine Teach me dear creature how to think and speak Lay open to my earthy gross conceit Smothered in errors feeble shallow weak The folded meaning of your words’ deceit Against my soul’s pure truth why labor you To make it wander in an unknown field Are you a god Would you create me new Transform me then and to your power I’ll yield But if that I am I then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine Nor to her bed no homage do I owe Far more far more to you do I decline O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears Sing Siren for thyself and I will dote Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie And in that glorious supposition think He gains by death that hath such means to die Let love being light be drownèd if she sink 
 
What are you mad that you do reason so 
 

 

 
Not mad but mated how I do not know 
 
It is a fault that springeth from your eye 
 

 

 
For gazing on your beams fair sun being by 
 
Gaze when you should and that will clear your sight 
 

 

 
As good to wink sweet love as look on night 
 
Why call you me love Call my sister so 
 

 

 
Thy sister’s sister 
 
That’s my sister 
 

 

 
No It is thyself mine own self’s better part Mine eye’s clear eye my dear heart’s dearer heart My food my fortune and my sweet hope’s aim My sole Earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim 
 
All this my sister is or else should be 
 

 

 
Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee Thee will I love and with thee lead my life Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife Give me thy hand 
 
O soft sir Hold you still I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill 
 

 

 
Why how now Dromio Where runn’st thou so fast 
 

 

 
Do you know me sir Am I Dromio Am I your man Am I myself
