That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown Besides the Thane of Cawdor But ’tis strange And oftentimes to win us to our harm The instruments of darkness tell us truths Win us with honest trifles to betray ’s In deepest consequence Cousins a word I pray you 
 
Two truths are told As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme I thank you gentlemen This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill cannot be good If ill Why hath it given me earnest of success Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor If good why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs Against the use of nature Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical Shakes so my single state of man That function is smothered in surmise And nothing is but what is not 
 
Look how our partner’s rapt 
 
If chance will have me king why chance may crown me Without my stir 
 
New honors come upon him Like our strange garments cleave not to their mold But with the aid of use 
 
Come what come may Time and the hour runs through the roughest day 
 
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure 
 
Give me your favor My dull brain was wrought With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them Let us toward the King Think upon what hath chanced and at more time The interim having weighed it let us speak Our free hearts each to other 
 
Very gladly 
 
Till then enough Come friends 
 
Is execution done on Cawdor Are not Those in commission yet returned 
 
My liege They are not yet come back But I have spoke With one that saw him die who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons Implored your Highness’ pardon and set forth A deep repentance Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle 
 
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust O worthiest cousin The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine Only I have left to say More is thy due than more than all can pay 
 
The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself Your Highness’ part Is to receive our duties and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants Which do but what they should by doing everything Safe toward your love and honor 
 
Welcome hither I have begun to plant thee and will labor To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo That hast no less deserved nor must be known No less to have done so let me enfold thee And hold thee to my heart 
 
There if I grow The harvest is your own 
 
My plenteous joys Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes And you whose places are the nearest know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine On all deservers From hence to Inverness And bind us further to you 
 
The rest is labor which is not used for you I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach So humbly take my leave 
 
My worthy Cawdor 
 
The Prince of Cumberland That is a step On which I must fall down or else o’erleap For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires Let not light see my black and deep desires The eye wink at the hand yet let that be Which the eye fears when it is done to see 
 
True worthy Banquo He is full so valiant And in his commendations I am fed It is a banquet to me Let’s after him Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome It is a peerless kinsman 
 

 
They met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the King who all-hailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title before these Weïrd Sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail king that shalt be This have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart and farewell Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way Thou wouldst be great Art not without ambition but without The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false And yet wouldst wrongly win Thou ’dst have great Glamis That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crowned withal What is your tidings 
 
The King comes here tonight 
 

 
Thou ’rt mad to say it Is not thy master with him who were ’t so Would have informed for preparation 
 
So please you it is true Our thane is coming One of my fellows had the speed of him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more Than would make up his message 
 

 
Give him tending He brings great news The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements Come you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between Th’ effect and it Come to my woman’s breasts And take my milk for gall you murd’ring ministers Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief Come thick night And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell That my keen knife see not the wound it makes Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry Hold hold Great Glamis worthy Cawdor Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present and I feel now The future in the instant 
 
My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight 
 

 
And when goes hence 
 
Tomorrow as he purposes 
 

 
O never Shall sun that morrow see Your face my thane is as a book where men May read strange matters To beguile the time Look like the time Bear welcome in your eye Your hand your tongue Look like th’ innocent flower But be the serpent under ’t He that’s coming Must be provided for and you shall put This night’s great business into my dispatch Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom 
 
We will speak further 
 

 
Only look up clear To alter favor ever is to fear Leave all the rest to me 
 
This castle hath a pleasant seat The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses 
 
This guest of summer The temple-haunting martlet does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle Where they most breed and haunt I have observed The air is delicate 
 
See see our honored hostess The love that follows us sometime is our trouble Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains And thank us for your trouble 
 

 
All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house For those of old And the late dignities heaped up to them We rest your hermits 
 
Where’s the Thane of Cawdor We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor but he rides well And his great love sharp as his spur hath helped him To his home before us Fair and noble hostess We are your guest tonight 
 

 
Your servants ever Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure Still to return your own 
 
Give me your hand Conduct me to mine host We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him By your leave hostess 
 
If it were done when ’tis done then ’twere well It were done quickly If th’ assassination Could trammel up the consequence and catch With his surcease success that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here But here upon this bank and shoal of time We’d jump the life to come But in these cases We still have judgment here that we but teach Bloody instructions which being taught return To plague th’ inventor This even-handed justice Commends th’ ingredience of our poisoned chalice To our own lips He’s here in double trust First as I am his kinsman and his subject Strong both against the deed then as his host Who should against his murderer shut the door Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been So clear in his great office that his virtues Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against The deep damnation of his taking-off And pity like a naked newborn babe Striding the blast or heaven’s cherubin horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent but only Vaulting ambition which o’erleaps itself And falls on th’ other How now what news 
 

 
He has almost supped Why have you left the chamber
