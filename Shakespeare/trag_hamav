Of Laertes 
 
His purse is empty already all ’s golden words golden words are spent 
 
Of him sir 
 
I know you are not ignorant 
 
I would you did sir Yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me Well sir 
 
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is 
 
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence But to know a man well were to know himself 
 
I mean sir for his weapon But in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he’s unfellowed 
 
What’s his weapon 
 
Rapier and dagger 
 
That’s two of his weapons But well 
 
The King sir hath wagered with him six Barbary horses against the which he has impawned as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit 
 
What call you the carriages 
 
I knew you must be edified by the margent by the margent ere you had done 
 
The carriages sir are the hangers 
 
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then But on Six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberal-conceited carriages that’s the French bet against the Danish Why is this all impawned as you call it 
 
The King sir hath laid sir that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits He hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your Lordship would vouchsafe the answer 
 
How if I answer no 
 
I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial 
 
Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty it is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose I will win for him an I can If not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits 
 
Shall I deliver you e’en so 
 
To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will 
 
I commend my duty to your Lordship 
 
Yours He does well to commend it himself There are no tongues else for ’s turn 
 
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head 
 
He did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it Thus has he and many more of the same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out 
 
My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time 
 
I am constant to my purposes They follow the King’s pleasure If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as now 
 
The King and Queen and all are coming down 
 
In happy time 
 
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play 
 
She well instructs me 
 
You will lose my lord 
 
I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in continual practice I shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart But it is no matter 
 
Nay good my lord 
 
It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman 
 
If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit 
 
Not a whit We defy augury There is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now ’tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come The readiness is all Since no man of aught he leaves knows what is ’t to leave betimes Let be 
 
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me 
 
Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong But pardon ’t as you are a gentleman This presence knows And you must needs have heard how I am punished With a sore distraction What I have done That might your nature honor and exception Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes Never Hamlet If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it Who does it then His madness If ’t be so Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy Sir in this audience Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o’er the house And hurt my brother 
 
I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge but in my terms of honor I stand aloof and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored But till that time I do receive your offered love like love And will not wrong it 
 
I embrace it freely And will this brothers’ wager frankly play Give us the foils Come on 
 
Come one for me 
 
I’ll be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night Stick fiery off indeed 
 
You mock me sir 
 
No by this hand 
 
Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet You know the wager 
 
Very well my lord Your Grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side 
 
I do not fear it I have seen you both But since he is better we have therefore odds 
 
This is too heavy Let me see another
