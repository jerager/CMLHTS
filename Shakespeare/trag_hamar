Do you see this O God 
 
Laertes I must commune with your grief Or you deny me right Go but apart Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touched we will our kingdom give Our crown our life and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction but if not Be you content to lend your patience to us And we shall jointly labor with your soul To give it due content 
 
Let this be so His means of death his obscure funeral No trophy sword nor hatchment o’er his bones No noble rite nor formal ostentation Cry to be heard as ’twere from heaven to earth That I must call ’t in question 
 
So you shall And where th’ offense is let the great ax fall I pray you go with me 
 
What are they that would speak with me 
 
Seafaring men sir They say they have letters for you 
 
Let them come in I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet 
 
God bless you sir 
 
Let Him bless thee too 
 
He shall sir an ’t please Him There’s a letter for you sir It came from th’ ambassador that was bound for England if your name be Horatio as I am let to know it is 
 
Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the King They have letters for him Ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valor and in the grapple I boarded them On the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for them Let the King have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter These good fellows will bring thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England of them I have much to tell thee Farewell He that thou knowest thine Hamlet Come I will give you way for these your letters And do ’t the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them 
 
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal And you must put me in your heart for friend Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life 
 
It well appears But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats So criminal and so capital in nature As by your safety greatness wisdom all things else You mainly were stirred up 
 
O for two special reasons Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed But yet to me they’re strong The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks and for myself My virtue or my plague be it either which She is so conjunctive to my life and soul That as the star moves not but in his sphere I could not but by her The other motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the general gender bear him Who dipping all his faults in their affection Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind Would have reverted to my bow again But not where I have aimed them 
 
And so have I a noble father lost A sister driven into desp’rate terms Whose worth if praises may go back again Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections But my revenge will come 
 
Break not your sleeps for that You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more I loved your father and we love ourself And that I hope will teach you to imagine How now What news 
 
Letters my lord from Hamlet These to your Majesty this to the Queen 
 
From Hamlet Who brought them 
 
Sailors my lord they say I saw them not They were given me by Claudio He received them Of him that brought them 
 
Laertes you shall hear them Leave us High and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return Hamlet What should this mean Are all the rest come back Or is it some abuse and no such thing 
 
Know you the hand 
 
’Tis Hamlet’s character Naked And in a postscript here he says alone Can you advise me 
 
I am lost in it my lord But let him come It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth Thus didst thou 
 
If it be so Laertes As how should it be so how otherwise Will you be ruled by me 
 
Ay my lord So you will not o’errule me to a peace 
 
To thine own peace If he be now returned As checking at his voyage and that he means No more to undertake it I will work him To an exploit now ripe in my device Under the which he shall not choose but fall And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident 
 
My lord I will be ruled The rather if you could devise it so That I might be the organ 
 
It falls right You have been talked of since your travel much And that in Hamlet’s hearing for a quality Wherein they say you shine Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one and that in my regard Of the unworthiest siege 
 
What part is that my lord 
 
A very ribbon in the cap of youth Yet needful too for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds Importing health and graveness Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy I have seen myself and served against the French And they can well on horseback but this gallant Had witchcraft in ’t He grew unto his seat And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast So far he topped my thought That I in forgery of shapes and tricks Come short of what he did 
 
A Norman was ’t 
 
A Norman 
 
Upon my life Lamord 
 
The very same 
 
I know him well He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation 
 
He made confession of you And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defense And for your rapier most especial That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed If one could match you The ’scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion guard nor eye If you opposed them Sir this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming-o’er to play with you Now out of this 
 
What out of this my lord 
 
Laertes was your father dear to you Or are you like the painting of a sorrow A face without a heart 
 
Why ask you this 
 
Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time And that I see in passages of proof Time qualifies the spark and fire of it There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it And nothing is at a like goodness still For goodness growing to a pleurisy Dies in his own too-much That we would do We should do when we would for this would changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues are hands are accidents And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing But to the quick of th’ ulcer Hamlet comes back what would you undertake To show yourself indeed your father’s son More than in words 
 
To cut his throat i’ th’ church 
 
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes Will you do this Keep close within your chamber Hamlet returned shall know you are come home We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together And wager on your heads He being remiss Most generous and free from all contriving Will not peruse the foils so that with ease Or with a little shuffling you may choose A sword unbated and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father 
 
I will do ’t And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword I bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that but dip a knife in it Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon can save the thing from death That is but scratched withal I’ll touch my point With this contagion that if I gall him slightly It may be death 
 
Let’s further think of this Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape If this should fail And that our drift look through our bad performance ’Twere better not assayed Therefore this project Should have a back or second that might hold If this did blast in proof Soft let me see We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings I ha ’t When in your motion you are hot and dry As make your bouts more violent to that end And that he calls for drink I’ll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping If he by chance escape your venomed stuck Our purpose may hold there But stay what noise 
 
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel So fast they follow Your sister’s drowned Laertes 
 
Drowned O where 
 
There is a willow grows askant the brook That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream Therewith fantastic garlands did she make Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clamb’ring to hang an envious sliver broke When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds As one incapable of her own distress Or like a creature native and endued Unto that element But long it could not be Till that her garments heavy with their drink Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death 
 
Alas then she is drowned 
 
Drowned drowned 
 
Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia And therefore I forbid my tears But yet It is our trick nature her custom holds Let shame say what it will When these are gone The woman will be out Adieu my lord I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze But that this folly drowns it
