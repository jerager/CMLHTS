O well done I commend your pains And everyone shall share i’ th’ gains And now about the cauldron sing Like elves and fairies in a ring Enchanting all that you put in 
 

 
By the pricking of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes Open locks Whoever knocks 
 
How now you secret black and midnight hags What is ’t you do 
 
A deed without a name 
 
I conjure you by that which you profess Howe’er you come to know it answer me Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches though the yeasty waves Confound and swallow navigation up Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down Though castles topple on their warders’ heads Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations though the treasure Of nature’s germens tumble all together Even till destruction sicken answer me To what I ask you 
 

 
Speak 
 

 
Demand 
 

 
We’ll answer 
 

 
Say if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths Or from our masters’ 
 
Call ’em Let me see ’em 
 

 
Pour in sow’s blood that hath eaten Her nine farrow grease that’s sweaten From the murderers’ gibbet throw Into the flame 
 
Come high or low Thyself and office deftly show 
 
Tell me thou unknown power 
 

 
He knows thy thought Hear his speech but say thou naught 
 

 
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth Beware Macduff Beware the Thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough 
 
Whate’er thou art for thy good caution thanks Thou hast harped my fear aright But one word more 
 

 
He will not be commanded Here’s another More potent than the first 
 

 
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth 
 
Had I three ears I’d hear thee 
 

 
Be bloody bold and resolute Laugh to scorn The power of man for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth 
 
Then live Macduff what need I fear of thee But yet I’ll make assurance double sure And take a bond of fate Thou shalt not live That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies And sleep in spite of thunder What is this That rises like the issue of a king And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty 
 
Listen but speak not to ’t 
 

 
Be lion-mettled proud and take no care Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him 
 
That will never be Who can impress the forest bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root Sweet bodements good Rebellious dead rise never till the Wood Of Birnam rise and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath To time and mortal custom Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing Tell me if your art Can tell so much shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom 
 
Seek to know no more 
 
I will be satisfied Deny me this And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know Why sinks that cauldron And what noise is this 
 

 
Show 
 

 
Show 
 

 
Show 
 
Show his eyes and grieve his heart Come like shadows so depart 
 
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo Down Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs And thy hair Thou other gold-bound brow is like the first A third is like the former Filthy hags Why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes What will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom Another yet A seventh I’ll see no more And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass Which shows me many more and some I see That twofold balls and treble scepters carry Horrible sight Now I see ’tis true For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me And points at them for his What is this so 
 

 
Ay sir all this is so But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly Come sisters cheer we up his sprites And show the best of our delights I’ll charm the air to give a sound While you perform your antic round That this great king may kindly say Our duties did his welcome pay 
 
Where are they Gone Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar Come in without there 
 
What’s your Grace’s will
